What Kind of Mine is This? After taking a rest in the cave, the Night Knights inspect the cave some more [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] had already discovered some old pickaxes and shovels as well as a mysterious type of stone during their night shift The stone is shiny, foggy, and seemingly naturally occurs in this cave No one has seen this kind of stone before It could be valuable Tia and Asurak break some of the some from the cave and take them Perhaps this is what [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] is actually after and why he sent us to clear the forest?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-11-There-is-Whitestone-at-the-Bottom-of-it-All/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-11-There-is-Whitestone-at-the-Bottom-of-it-All/</guid><description>2022-06-08
The Miner’s Office Inspecting the door in the other side of the bridge, the Night Knights find that it is much smaller and not made for the wagon to go through but instead seems to hide a room The wagon tracks continue around a corner [[Ruby]] picks the lock of the door and reveals a room behind it with some drawers, cupboards, shelves and a desk: the office of the mine In the desk, [[Runa]] finds old and fragile parchments, a ring with a key, and some notes The parchments contain a order to broaden the mines as well as a receipt for 20.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-12-Corruption-in-the-Ankheg-Kingdom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-12-Corruption-in-the-Ankheg-Kingdom/</guid><description>2022-07-01
An Interrupted Night The Night Knights attempt to take a long rest in the office in the cave Because the rest of the party are still very much charmed by the mushroom people, [[Ruby]] and [[Runa]] decide to be part of the watches and also keep an eye on their friends The first watch goes by uneventful for [[Tia]] and [[Runa]] During the second watch, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] notices some noises in front of the locked office door Due to some loud noises from the sleeping party members, the noises seem to come closer, and vibrations are felt We quickly wake up and prepare for an [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg]] attack: Tia opens the locked door to make space for fighting, we position ourselves Three Ankhegs appear: one burrowing inside the office, two outside on the space before the chasm We manage to kill them off relatively unscathed but more Ankhegs (of the corrupted kind) can be heard and seen coming up from the chasm Figuring that there is no way of getting that long rest, we decide to make a run for it The [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankegs]] do not immediately chase after us but stop to feast on the [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg]] cadavers first On the Run We make our way through the tunnels towards to exit Not feeling immediately chased anymore, we slow down In the tunnels, we find a wooden alcove that seems to have been a workspace In a locked box that can be opened with the key we found in the office before, Ruby and Heilar find a ring and a healing potion; Heilar wears the ring; it is a [[Items/Ring of Spell Storing]] In another, non-locked box, Runa finds residue of a green power: [[Items/Whitestone|Residuum]].</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-13-Swamp-Connections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-13-Swamp-Connections/</guid><description>2022-07-07

(One Shot / Side Quest)
What the F? The Night Knights go to bed after encountering the Rakshasa and soon wake up in a nightly mountain scenery [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] is not there They also soon notice that all their magical items are gone Looking at the land around them, [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] recognizes this to be near the town of [[Places/Deastok]], about two days of travel from where they went to bed Climbing a tree, [[Ruby]] sees city lights in the distance There is also a path leading into the opposite direction The group decides to go to the village Of Rocks and Rocs Suddenly, a gargantuan bird is flying nearby and seems to stalk the group Guessing that hiding will not help, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]] throws a rock at the bird and the [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Roc]] attacks Quickly, multiple people are going down in the fight [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] sees gates in the nearby mountain and tells the group to flee there Due to a combination of [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] distracting the bird and then playing dead, [[Asurak]] throwing distracting sausages, and [[Runa]]’s spell slowing the bird, everyone makes it to the gates Another Creepy Mine The gates have an inscription in Elvish saying [[Places/Herathis Mines]] The locked door opens upon [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]’s touch Inside, there is creepy fog and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] has the weird urge to follow the fog Also, there is more [[Items/Whitestone]] but it glows and lights up in Davelors hands (but not the old Whitestone in Tia’s bag) The group follows the mine, takes and elevator down and sees strange runes on the Whitestone that are written in Abyssal and seems to be of abjurative, protective nature (maybe not let Davelor touch it?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-16-The-Lorekeepers-Son/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-16-The-Lorekeepers-Son/</guid><description>2022-09-22
A weird awakening After realizing that everyone except [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] had the same dream, the party decides that some research is due before facing the [[Places/Herathis Mines]] again, so they want to visit the villages lorekeeper for some answers Before going there, Heilar frees Davelor and Asurak of their curses In a quiet moment, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] shows [[Runa]] the diary of his mother [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] that is mostly written in Abyssal First part is written in common and describes normal day-to-day stuff like getting supplies but also the fight with [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] about whether or not to fight to protect the forest (that led him to leave) After that, more and more Abyssal creeps in She describes brewing potions, crafting spellfocuses, making magic ink and other magic items There are also arcane symbols in Abyssal One of the [[Items/Potion of Water Breathing|potions]] described seems similar to what we found in the [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Hag]]’s hut and after the dream The ink used to write the diary is not normal ink but doesn’t seem to possess magical properties anymore (we think maybe she got possessed by something because to the best of our knowledge she did not know Abyssal) [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] still believes that his mother wouldn’t hurt us and that we need to save her [[Runa]] promises to do her best to help and also does not tell the rest of the party about the diary Meeting the Lorekeeper Still early in the morning, the party heads over to [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Lyra and Fhaonik Eillir]]&amp;rsquo;s place They are an elderly elven couple, very friendy Telling them about our dreams and the runes, we find a very old-looking book that has very similar runes describing something like an arcane lock or anker (i.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-17-How-to-Lose-Your-Wizard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-17-How-to-Lose-Your-Wizard/</guid><description>2022-09-29
Inside the Mystery Hut Being in need of a rest but not wanting to let our target escape, we decide to let Sherlock, still in snake form (the infamous Snakelock) scout ahead Snakelock quickly gets into the hut, discovering it to be a former hunting cabin that is dusty but has several pairs of footsteps in the dust Straight ahead there is a larger room with a (recently) used fireplace, a table, and several books and scrolls To the left there is a smaller sleeping chamber with a bed that seems to have been recently used As the hut seems to be empty, we decide to enter and investigate while some members take a rest Directly heading for the bed, [[Asurak]] finds a handkerchief and goes to sleep [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] investigates the fireplace and finds remains of burned parchment in there [[Runa]] finds a hidden door under the table, and in cooperation with [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], they manage to detect and disarm an alarm spell In the books, [[Runa]] finds information on ritual binding (e.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-18-Meet-the-Family/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-18-Meet-the-Family/</guid><description>2022-10-06
That’s a Weirdly Short Kidnapping Runa is taken to the cellar of the nearby hut by the [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Gormon|elf]] Asked about why they are interested in the [[Places/Herathis Mines]], she repeats that they are investigating the sickness and clues seem to lead to the mines The elf, [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Gormon|Gormon Eilir]], explains that he once went there looking for answers too, but the answers found him Asked about these answers, he replies that “we will find out soon enough” He ties up [[Runa]] with the rope, but seems to not be used to this task - she could probably free herself after a while He talks about his master (maybe the [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Chainbreaker]]?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-19-Deastok-Deeds-and-Misdeeds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-19-Deastok-Deeds-and-Misdeeds/</guid><description>2022-10-09
Arrival in Deastok The group arrives in [[Places/Deastok]] which is a fairly large city (population of 10.000) and enters through the Jeweled Gates manned by crownsguards Deastok is a nice city that sees many tourists 3 districts: Jeweled Gates (housing the crownsguard barracks), Garden Grounds (mostly residential homes), and Bursar Plaza (Industrial District, shops, inns, etc) Heading to the Industrial District, we see three Inns: [[Places/Tooth &amp;amp; Nail]], the [[Places/Boar’s Head]], and [[Places/Pinn’s Inn]] Ruby, Asurak, Reznak, and Davelor check out the Tooth &amp;amp; Nail which is empty except from the Dwarven bar women that [[Asurak]] unsuccessfully tries to use his charms on In the Boar’s Head, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] meet [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Milton Derstip]] Hasn’t heard about sickness, but talk to [[Westeron Purthis]] at the [[Temple of Bahamut]] (the Platinum Dragon) The Mines are about 3 hours to the East, the miners usually stay there during their work, but can be found in the [[Places/Coal’s Row Tavern and Backery]] For magic weapons, he recommends the [[Places/Dungeon’s Delight]] Books may be found in the [[Temple of Bahamut]] and the starosta is known to have a semi-public library [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], meanwhile, goes off to a jewelery shop called the [[Places/Golden Crest]] and sells one of the rubies for 5000 goldpieces, he also learns about a magic shop called Spellbound Runa talks to a busker running a card game but does not find out more Meeting up again and sharing their intel, the group figures out that Heilar tried to hide having sold the ruby but make him go back and sell another one, as well as buy a pearl for Runa We then head to the [[Places/Dungeon’s Delight]] in search of magical weapons They have a [[Items/Berserker&amp;rsquo;s Axe]], a [[Magical Rapier]] and a [[Magical Shield]] We buy the Rapier for Tia and the Shield for Heilar, as well as some non-magical armor for Avaaros and Davelor Next, we head to [[Places/Spellbound]] They have a lot of different spell scrolls, [[Everlasting Smoke]], a [[Ring of Protection]] (+1 AC), and [[Goggles of Night]], a [[Items/Giantslayer Axe]] We buy the [[Items/Giantslayer Axe]] for Asurak, and Sending, Counterspell, and Mage Armor scrolls for Runa [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] gets some supplies to make healing potions [[Runa]] starts studying the spell scrolls [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[Asurak]], and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] head to the [[Places/Coal’s Row Tavern and Backery]] to get some intel from the miners They order a round for everyone and sit with some miners They hear that there are some [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Ankhegs]] and other beasts in the mine, also some of the weird/corrupted ones Many miners transferred to [[Places/Hupperdook]] for coal mining because of the war Crownsguard are stationed there to keep the mine safe Jobs would be posted at the town’s hall They also quickly check out the town’s hall, a stately homestead, but the blackboard only has a posting asking to report any [[Kryn]] activity Curiosities and Chaos at the Circus Since there is a circus in town, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Syrja]] (who stayed with us), [[Runa]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Reznak]] decide to pay it a visit Meanwhile [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], and [[Ruby]] do a pub crawl (and the ruby gets stolen), and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] stays in to finish potions The circus has a big purple and green tent and a few outside tents with a fortune teller (Frivolous Fortunes) and a band (Billy and the Boys) A tall orc bouncer with tribal tattoos collects the entry fees Tia and Syrja get their fortunes told [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] will lose someone close to her in the near future (someone she hasn’t seen in a long time) and she will go swimming in the ocean [[People &amp;amp; Groups/Syrja]] will find love but also suffer a great loss forcing her to make a harsh decision In the entry tent, creatures are presented in cages A [[Manticore]] A [[Sealion|talking Kenku]] A Yuan-Ti pureblood A giant ape A gigantuan snake An Aarakokra We start talking to the Kenku, whose name is [[Sealion]].</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-2-Where-Have-All-the-Children-Gone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-2-Where-Have-All-the-Children-Gone/</guid><description>2022-02-17

We Shall Pass We arrive at the mine on a carved plateau under a stone overhang Over the gates there is a carved writing of “[[Places/Herathis Mines]] under the xxx of King Bertrand Dwendal” We show our letter to the crownsguard at the entrance and are let in We follow voices to find the [[Eirrendell Kevandor|work manager]] arguing with an employee, a badass dwarven woman called [[Corinna Minatore]], about work safety We interrupt to offer our help and learn that they don’t have an [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Ankhegs]] problem but that there are problems with some little critters and with bigger [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Phase Spiders|spiders]] They usually don’t come up beyond the 2nd level (and they don’t go below that) but its getting more They also heard noises of something much scarier (whimpering sound, like a wounded animal) A worker named [[Jared]] (dwarf, no beard) has been missing, he is the engineer who could fix the broken elevators There are few workers out there right now, but there are some outposts of equipment we could use The [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Phase Spiders|spiders]] make big nets and are drawn to flame There is a spring below the mine Eventually, we are allowed to explore the mine and fight the spiders, but the work manager doesn’t promise us any additional payment Level 1: (Dis-)Appearing Spiders We start exploring the first level of the [[Places/Herathis Mines]] and spot a chest in a dimly-lit cavern Feeling the need to know what’s in the chest, we approach it and are attacked by [[Monsters &amp;amp; Foes/Phase Spiders]] that can attack and then disappear.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-21-Shit-is-Getting-Weirder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sakritz.github.io/dungeons-and-beans/Sessions/Session-21-Shit-is-Getting-Weirder/</guid><description>2022-10-27
