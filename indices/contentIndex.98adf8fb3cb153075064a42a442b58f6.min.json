You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.  \n  \nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.  \n  \nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.

days\n* We are starting in [[Wolfsglenn]] near the [[Cyrengreen Forest]]\n\n### The Inciting Incident\n* We are in the [[Golden Comb Tavern \u0026 Inn]]\n\t* barkeeper is [[Melvin]] (halfling, red hair, red beard, rather strong)\n- We hear a ruckus in a room\n- There is a dead person lying on the floor in the room\n\t- the neck is dislocated\n\t- bruises that seem to come from the inside\n\t- conspicuously inconspicuous person: man, ca 35, well-groomed, but inconspicuous\n- There are no footprints in the room, something flees out the window (no one sees it, presumably it was the shadow)\n- The [[Crownsguard]] arrives, [[Dalee]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros]] are basically suspicious and are not allowed to leave Wolfsglenn \n- Melvin tells that the dead man is Mr. [[Vorgal Telsteg|Telsteg]] who has been there for about 5 days and was assigned by [[Liza Vorn|Liza]] to do some investigation\n- Some are thinking of leaving the Inn and staying at the Inn \"Zum roten Apfel\" with  [[Salem]] instead.\n\n### Attack in the alley\n- [[Dalee]] and [[Reznak]] (in the backpack) leave the Inn and make their way to the red apple\n- In the alley next door they are attacked by a [[Shadow]]\n\t- The shadow travels through the body causing necrotic damage that leaves bruises just like [[Vorgal Telsteg]]'s\n\t- Melee attacks seem to have little effect on the shadow\n\t- We all join the fight\n\t- The shadow is undead\n\t- Magic missile damages the shadow a lot\n\t- The shadow flees\n* [[Dalee]] is dead\n- In order not to be caught with a corpse again, we decide to bury the body in the forest\n* [[Runa]] creates a distraction with Minor Illusions of cries for help from the direction of the marketplace to keep the patrolling Crownguard busy\n* The rest make their way into the forest with the body\n\n\n### Burial and Ambush in the Forest\n- [[Reznak]], [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] make it to the forest and bury the body\n- On the way back they notice movement and discover a [[Blights|Vineblight]] attacking them\n\t- [[Blights|Vineblights]] are living entanglements of vines, they do not bode well, are they related to dark magic?\n\t- There is also a [[Blights|Twigblight]] and a [[Blights|Needleblight]] coming along and joining the fight\n\t- Long and dangerous fight, all are seriously injured\n\t- Finally the Blights can be defeated, among other things with fire\n- Everyone makes their way back to the [[Golden Comb Tavern \u0026

This?\n- After taking a rest in the cave, the Night Knights inspect the cave some more\n- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] had already discovered some old pickaxes and shovels as well as a mysterious type of stone during their night shift\n\t- The stone is shiny, foggy, and seemingly naturally occurs in this cave\n\t- No one has seen this kind of stone before\n\t- It could be valuable\n\t- Tia and Asurak break some of the some from the cave and take them\n- Perhaps this is what [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] is actually after and why he sent us to clear the forest?\n\t- There are some other mines in the areas, for example the [[Herathis Mines]] a bit north, which are platinum mines\n\t- Runa knows that mines can only be exploited with the express permission of the Crown - so it would make sense if [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] wants to keep the mine a secret\n\n### Deeper into the Mine\n- [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] scout one of the two tunnel entrances for the group\n\t- They climb some rubble and find tracks\n\t- Following them, they enter a cave in which they discover cocoons – seven empty and three still developing ones\n\t- Avaaros cuts open one cocoon and discovers them to be [[Ankhegs|Ankheg]] cocoons\n\t- They alert the group\n- Everyone makes their way deeper into the mine\n\t- Unfortunately, the tunnel collapses behind them as they cross the cave-in; now, the only way forward is deeper into the mines\n\t- After killing the three cocooned [[Ankhegs]], the group goes further\n\t- [[Ruby]], who is taking the lead, accidentally sets off a trap in the entrance to another cave – she is hit by rocks as she sets of a trap-wire\n\t-In this cavern, there is a large door towards which the tracks are leading\n\t- Close to the door, there are two dead bodies (one almost a skeleton)\n\t- Inspecting the bodies, Tia finds a notebook with a note on one of them\n- The note seems to bear instructions in form of a riddle on how to open the door. There are 9 levers on the door and the riddle reveals which two must be pulled\n![[Pasted image 20221216192244.png]]\n- After successfully solving the riddle and opening the door (yay, teamwork), the group finds a wagon and further tracks\n- Tia and Avaaros (with help from Asurak and Davelor) ride the wagon down the tracks but they derail at a junction\n- Taking the left path, the group enters another cavern which contains a questionably stalwart bridge (for the tracks) leading to yet another door\n- [[Ruby]] successfully makes it across the bridge and secures a rope for others\n- When [[Runa]] follows, she is attacked from above\n \n\n### Fighting in the Dark\n- As Runa is crossing the bridge, something falls from above and wraps around her head:  a [[Darkmantle]]\n- The creature causes her to be blind and unable to speak or breathe while also emitting magical darkness\n- Reznak manages to free Runa by putting the creature to sleep but is attacked and incacitated by another one of these creatures\n- Being unable to see the creatures in the darkness, the group has a hard time hitting them\n- During the fight, Ruby admits that her dagger  may be cursed\n- But through a combination of lucky attacks, sleep spells (which dissolve the darkness) and brave attacks, the group finally kills all four of these Darkmantles\n- Everyone successfully crosses the bridge\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-11-There-is-Whitestone-at-the-Bottom-of-it-All":{"title":"","content":"2022-06-08\n\n### The Miner’s Office \n- Inspecting the door in the other side of the bridge, the Night Knights find that it is much smaller and not made for the wagon to go through but instead seems to hide a room\n- The wagon tracks continue around a corner\n- [[Ruby]] picks the lock of the door and reveals a room behind it with some drawers, cupboards, shelves and a desk: the office of the mine\n- In the desk, [[Runa]] finds old and fragile parchments, a ring with a key, and some notes\n\t- The parchments contain a order to broaden the mines as well as a receipt for 20.000 pounds of [[Whitestone]]\n\t- [[Whitestone]] is a city in [[Tal’Dorei]] known for the stone of the same name. Whitestone is a material that has special properties and is used to make [[Whitestone|Residuum]] (ratio of 3:1 from Whitestone to Residuum) which is a material that can substitute material components for spell\n\t- #question Whitestone is very rare and usually not found here in this area\n\t- A pound of Residuum is worth about 15.000 gold pieces\n\t- The parchments also reveal that the mine was generally referred to as a coalmine, thus probably hiding the presence of Whitestone in there\n\t- The receipt has a sigil at the bottom that [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] recognizes as that of the [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] family =\u003e he probably knows about the Whitestone\n- There is also some boxes in the room in which [[Ruby]] finds a locked crate. However, when picking the lock, the crate is empty\n- Runa, however, looks at a mirror in the room that is opposite of Ruby and the crate. Inspecting is, she doesn’t find anything interesting at first but when she puts her hand against it on a hunch, her hand enters the [[mirror]]\n\t- With [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]s help, [[Runa]] sees that “behind” the mirror, there is a mirror version of the room they are in\n\t- Tia and Runa enter and find two bottles of reddish liquid in the crate in the mirror room, which are a [[greater healing potion]] and a [[superior healing potion]]\n\t- To better understand the mirror room, Tia takes a pen and breaks another one\n\t- Trying to leave, Tia and Runa then find that the mirror has become solid and doesn’t let them pass\n\t- Being able to make a connection to the others via the message cantrip, Runa instructs them to also break the pen and as the rooms are the same again, the mirror can be passed again\n\t- The mirror basically contains a pocket dimension but doesn’t seem to work when moved to another location, so we leave it there\n\n### Meeting (and Fighting) the Ankheg Queen\n- Following the wagon tracks further into the mine, the Night Knights arrive at the head of another cavern-like room, on top of an elevator-like wooden construction\n- In the cavern, they encounter another group of [[Ankhegs]], 4 [[Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankhegs]], 2 “normal” Ankhegs and an [[Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]]\n- In a group effort involving an enlarged Ruby, bear Avaaros and lots of hits and acid sprays, the Night Knights finally manage to kill all of the Ankhegs\n- Asurak take the head of the Ankheg Queen, which seems to be not fully grown yet\n- In the cave, we also find some more [[Whitestone]], more egg sacks in a pool of water, and some mining instruments\n\n### We Made a Mushroom-Friend\n- While following the tunnels ahead and arguing about [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]s intentions, we suddenly hear a sound behind us\n- Inspecting its source, Avaaros (in dog form) discovers a very small, mushroom-like person\n- Carefully approaching it, we strike up a (mental) conversation with the seemingly very intelligent person\n\t- We learn that he has been following us for some time and doesn’t like noise\n\t- He has also seen the previous mine’s foreman (a dwarf) being killed in a fight by a “big and hairy” person (likely his boss) and then everyone left\n\t- He says that there is much more [[Whitestone]] in the mine\n\t- His family is living further below and are larger so they can’t come out\n\t- He can emit spores that charm people (currently everyone except Runa and Ruby are charmed and very protective of our little friend)\n- Avaaros in dog form with Sherlock on his back is then taken to meet his family\n\t- There are many and large mushroom-people down in the cave\n\t- They are called [[Mikonoids]] or [[Mikonoids|Spore Clan]]\n\t- There is a lot of Whitestone down there\n\t- There is one exit of the mine left if we follow the tunnels but there are also more Ankhegs up ahead\n- After this encounter we head back to the previous cavern to take a long rest\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-12-Corruption-in-the-Ankheg-Kingdom":{"title":"","content":"2022-07-01\n\n### An Interrupted Night\n- The Night Knights attempt to take a long rest in the office in the cave\n- Because the rest of the party are still very much charmed by the mushroom people, [[Ruby]] and [[Runa]] decide to be part of the watches and also keep an eye on their friends\n- The first watch goes by uneventful for [[Tia]] and [[Runa]]\n- During the second watch, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] notices some noises in front of the locked office door\n- Due to some loud noises from the sleeping party members, the noises seem to come closer, and vibrations are felt\n- We quickly wake up and prepare for an [[Ankhegs|Ankheg]] attack: Tia opens the locked door to make space for fighting, we position ourselves\n- Three Ankhegs appear: one burrowing inside the office, two outside on the space before the chasm\n- We manage to kill them off relatively unscathed but more Ankhegs (of the corrupted kind) can be heard and seen coming up from the chasm\n- Figuring that there is no way of getting that long rest, we decide to make a run for it\n- The [[Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankegs]] do not immediately chase after us but stop to feast on the [[Ankhegs|Ankheg]] cadavers first\n\n### On the Run\n- We make our way through the tunnels towards to exit\n- Not feeling immediately chased anymore, we slow down\n- In the tunnels, we find a wooden alcove that seems to have been a workspace\n\t- In a locked box that can be opened with the key we found in the office before, Ruby and Heilar find a ring and a healing potion; Heilar wears the ring; it is a [[Ring of Spell Storing]]\n\t- In another, non-locked box, Runa finds residue of a green power: [[Whitestone|Residuum]]. She scrapes together what she can find of it and puts it in a vial\n\n### She’s a real [[Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]]\n- Sneaking ahead, Heilar and Ruby (together with a glowing Sherlock) come up to a large cavern in which they see two shapes, one in Ankheg shape and size and one much larger\n- The Night Knights discuss how to best approach this situation but unfortunately take too long and are noticed by the [[Ankhegs]]\n- In the cavern, there are five [[Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankhegs]] and the gigantic adult [[Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]]\n- In a long and strenuous fight including legendary actions and legendary saves as well as Ruby, Davelor, and Tia briefly go down, the Night Knights finally manage to kill all of the Ankhegs\n\n### There’s Some Corruption Going On\n- Asurak and Davelor take off the Ankheg Queen’s head and take it with them\n- Inspecting her body, we find that she is covered in a strange, oily substance that makes her seem iridescent\n- The same oily substance can also be found in a river close to her original position in the cave. The oily substance seems to originate from a place upstream that is beyond the cavern and the available tunnels\n- In the river, there are again some egg sacks, most of them empty, the others seemingly damaged\n- The [[Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]] looks like the [[Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankhegs]]\n- We also saw/heard her eating one of the normal Ankhegs when we entered the cave\n- We don’t know what exactly is going on with the corruption but \n\t- Davelor senses something magical/holy going on?\n\t- Runa has heard of corruption before but would need to do further research (e.g., in Zadash)\n- We decide to call it a day, take the elevator in the cavern up to the top and take a rest in the forest above\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-13-Swamp-Connections":{"title":"","content":"2022-07-07\n\n### Tactical Decisions\n- Waking up the next morning, the Knight Nights discuss their next steps\n\t- [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] demanded all Ankhegs to be killed – so what would happen if Ankhegs showed up after we reported success?\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]]’ objectives are to protect the mushroom people but also to get revenge (and ideally kill) Roseseeker\n\t- Can we talk to [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] and hide that we know about the [[Whitestone]]?\n\t- What is up with the corruption in the river?\n- Finally, we decide to first find out where the river and corruption are coming from and see if that helps in deciding what to do about [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]\n\n### Upstream We Go\n- Apparently, [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] has wandered off during the night – seemingly on his own volition – in a northern direction\n- We decide to use Sherlock to follow the river: Sherlock gets transformed into a poisonous snake that is able to swim through the river, and using an earring from Avaaros, both he and Heilar are able to track Sherlock’s movements in the river\n- We follow Sherlock for about 3 hours in a northern/north-western direction (we get about 3,5 miles)\n\t- The water is not comfortable for Sherlock but he does not take damage\n\t- However, the river is difficult to follow upstream because of many slim passages\n\t- Finally, we end up in a swamp with muddy (and already weird-smelling) water and sickly animals\n\n### Fuckin’ Lights\n- Trying to track the smell of the corrupted water, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] in wolf-form wanders into the swamp and is attacked by something in the water\n\t- We fight a [[Drowned Maiden]], her drowned companion and some [[Will-o'-Wisps]]\n\t- Drowned maiden grapples many people with her hairs\n\t- All of them are resistant to non-magical damage\n\t- [[Will-o'-Wisps]] reduce everyone to 0 hitpoints on a failed con-save\n- Finally, after a long struggle with several of the Night Knights going down, we manage to kill them\n- Going through the pockets of the drowned people, we see that the clothes seem of Elven make, in earth tones\n\t- The [[Drowned Maiden]] seems to have been a druid, we find a stone statue that was her druidic focus\n\t- She seems a little mutated/corrupted\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] recognizes the two bodies as people from his village which is further north and promptly goes into shock\n\n### The Night Knights at Night\n- To rest for the night, [[Runa]] conjures up a tiny hut\n- During the watches, the different pairs share some more personal information with each other\n\t- [[Ruby]] shares with Avaaros that she escaped from prison once and was betrayed by her friends (who didn’t help her in prison) and boyfriend (who had another girlfriend when she got out of prison)\n\t- Reznak and Aurak get some bonding time in which [[Reznak]] shares that he spend most of his life in an attic and dreamed of attending a bard’s college – he also hopes that it may be possible to revive his brother\n\t- [[Asurak]] shares that he doesn’t like being angry but swore that he will find the murderer of his forster parents (who were killed by a band of bandits whose leader he is pursuing)\n\t- [[Runa]] shares her upbringing and her secret parchment with [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-14-Home-Weird-Home":{"title":"","content":"2022-07-21\n\n### To the Village\n- The next morning, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] tells the rest of the Night Knights that he recognizes the drowned people. The maiden was one of the few druids in his home village\n- So everyone decides to pay the village a visit and hand over the bodies\n- Heilar says that the last time he has been home, there was no swamp\n- Heading towards the village, the landscape changes. We leave the swamp and enter a dark uncanny forest\n- After about half a day, we reach the village\n- [[Reznak]] also remembers this village because is brother came from there\n- Because [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] doesn’t want to enter the village, we leave him and Ruby to watch over the bodies and head in without them\n- In the village, we see about 10 houses/huts, but no one is around and it is very quiet\n- Yelling “hello” an older female elf exits one of the huts and then invites us in\n\n### Meet the Parents\n- After a few words, the female elf, [[People \u0026 Groups/Ithil Caerdonel]], who declared that her husband is away talking to the village head, she leaves us to get the both of them\n- Returning with them,we meet [[Oland Kelvaris]], the village head – a tall elf with an Oaktree symbol on his belt buckle – and [[People \u0026 Groups/Haldir Caerdonel]], the woman’s husband\n- During introductions, Oland seems to recognize [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]]’s name\n- Upon telling him why we came to the village and how we had to fight their undead people, he want to inspect the bodies themselves\n\t- He identifies the drowned maiden as [[Silyana]], a druid, who vanished after heading out to find the source of the mysterious sickness\n\t- He tells us that “these were not the only ones who weren’t feeling great lately”, many of their people have been sick for months\n\t- They are suspecting the rivers as the source of the problem (there are three main rivers, two to the east and one to the west, which is supposed to be the problematic one)\n\t- He explains that [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]]’s mother [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] was there to help but vanished. She acted weirdly erratic and didn’t seem to care about the sick people. Oland’s daughter [[Numbra Kelvaris]] (who is also sick) was the last to talk to her\n\t- [[People \u0026 Groups/Isandra Caerdonel]], the daughter of Ithil and Haldir, is also sick, their older son has left to find a cure but hasn’t returned yet\n\t- When [[Asurak]] mentions [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]]’s name, both Ithil and Haldir react strongly to it. They are his parents\n\n### A not-so-happy family reunion\n- Upon hearing Heilar’s name, [[People \u0026 Groups/Ithil Caerdonel|Ithil]] heads upstairs to tend to their sick daughter and [[Runa]] follows her\n- She learns that [[People \u0026 Groups/Isandra Caerdonel]] has been sick for 9 or 10 months now, possibly after swimming in the river\n- After seeing the family heartbroken about [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] being gone for a long time now and also being very bad at hiding that she knows him, Runa makes Heilar come to meet his family\n- Upon him entering, Oland takes the rest of the Night Knights away to meet Numbra, while Runa tries to disappear into another chamber to give the family some privacy\n\n### The mysterious reappearing of [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]\n- Being taken to [[Numbra Kelvaris|Numbra]], the Night Knights to their own surprise also meet [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] who apparently had been fished out of the river (the potentially bad one) the night before \n- He does not remember what he has been up to the past two days\n- At dinner, he tells the rest of the Night Knights that there is a god, the [[Chainbreaker]], who is talking to him since his first near-death experience (a voice in darkness) \n\t- They made a deal, the Chainbreaker wants his chains to be broken\n\t- He is in chains because “the people do not understand his ways”\n- Trying to figure out what he did in the time he doesn’t have any memories about (if maybe the [[Chainbreaker]] is controlling him at that time), Runa tries to detect his thoughts but only sees darkness and is shoved out by something although [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] himself did not resist\n- If we want to do some research on the Chainbreaker, [[Lyra and Fhaonik Eillir]] have the most extensive library in the village\n\n### Magic Toads and Late Night Decisions\n- As [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], and [[Runa]] are on their way to the city and Avaaros, Ruby and Tia have already headed in, [[Asurak]] decides to plant his [[Bag of Beans|magic bean]] in the ground and 12 pink toads appear\n- Hearing the commotion, Davelor, Heilar, and Runa head back and see the toads\n- As Runa takes one of the into her hands, it transforms into a [[Horned Devil]] which is immediately killed by [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] \n- Touching another one, a [[Lamia]], a sphinx-like creature appears\n\t- While fighting it, [[Asurak]] is commanded to kill his companions and takes damage as he resists \n\t- After killing the creature, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] cures [[Asurak]] from that curse\n- Finally, [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] licks a toad and a dressed tiger-like creature, a [[Rakshasa]], appears\n\t- He seems to be immune to all magic spells the companions have as well as most weapon damage\n\t- He quickly overpowers Davelor, the only member of the party able to hurt him and the Night Knights (now involving also Avaaros and Tia) realize they don’t stand a chance and flee\n\t- The creature says “I will remember that face” to Davelor and disappears\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-15-Dream-a-Little-Dream-of-Death":{"title":"","content":"2022-08-04\n\n(One Shot / Side Quest)\n\n### What the F?\n- The Night Knights go to bed after encountering the Rakshasa and soon wake up in a nightly mountain scenery\n- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] is not there\n- They also soon notice that all their magical items are gone\n- Looking at the land around them, [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] recognizes this to be near the town of [[Deastok]], about two days of travel from where they went to bed\n- Climbing a tree, [[Ruby]] sees city lights in the distance\n- There is also a path leading into the opposite direction\n- The group decides to go to the village\n\n### Of Rocks and Rocs\n- Suddenly, a gargantuan bird is flying nearby and seems to stalk the group\n- Guessing that hiding will not help, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]] throws a rock at the bird and the [[Roc]] attacks\n\t- Quickly, multiple people are going down in the fight\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] sees gates in the nearby mountain and tells the group to flee there\n\t- Due to a combination of [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] distracting the bird and then playing dead, [[Asurak]] throwing distracting sausages, and [[Runa]]’s spell slowing the bird, everyone makes it to the gates\n\n### Another Creepy Mine\n- The gates have an inscription in Elvish saying [[Herathis Mines]]\n- The locked door opens upon [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]’s touch\n- Inside, there is creepy fog and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] has the weird urge to follow the fog\n- Also, there is more [[Whitestone]] but it glows and lights up in Davelors hands (but not the old Whitestone in Tia’s bag)\n- The group follows the mine, takes and elevator down and sees strange runes on the Whitestone that are written in Abyssal and seems to be of abjurative, protective nature (maybe not let Davelor touch it?)\n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] (in wolf form) also smells his mother\n- Crossing a chasm and following a spiralling path into a pit with more fog at the bottom, the group finally reaches a river that seems to spring from a chamber behind three stone archways and flows into east/west directions\n- Still smelling his mother, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] goes into the river and into the chamber\n- The water is warm for [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] but cold for the others\n- In the chamber, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sees his mother on a platform above the water, [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] is humming and writing in a book\n- After being addressed by Avaaros, Cecilia touches his face and then turns into water and attack\n- More [[Water Elementals]] appear and start to overpower and drown us\n\t- Weirdly, [[Runa]] hits one over the point of being dead but it still isn’t\n- As we are drowning, a symbol lights up on the platform [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] was on and cracks appear in it\n\n{insert image

awakening\n- After realizing that everyone except [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] had the same dream, the party decides that some research is due before facing the [[Herathis Mines]] again, so they want to visit the villages lorekeeper for some answers\n- Before going there, Heilar frees Davelor and Asurak of their curses\n- In a quiet moment, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] shows [[Runa]] the diary of his mother [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] that is mostly written in Abyssal\n\t- First part is written in common and describes normal day-to-day stuff like getting supplies but also the fight with [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] about whether or not to fight to protect the forest (that led him to leave)\n\t- After that, more and more Abyssal creeps in\n\t- She describes brewing potions, crafting spellfocuses, making magic ink and other magic items\n\t- There are also arcane symbols in Abyssal\n\t- One of the [[Potion of Water Breathing|potions]] described seems similar to what we found in the [[Hag]]’s hut and after the dream\n\t- The ink used to write the diary is not normal ink but doesn’t seem to possess magical properties anymore\n\t- (we think maybe she got possessed by something because to the best of our knowledge she did not know Abyssal)\n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] still believes that his mother wouldn’t hurt us and that we need to save her\n- [[Runa]] promises to do her best to help and also does not tell the rest of the party about the diary\n\n### Meeting the Lorekeeper\n- Still early in the morning, the party heads over to [[Lyra and Fhaonik Eillir]]'s place\n- They are an elderly elven couple, very friendy \n- Telling them about our dreams and the runes, we find a very old-looking book that has very similar runes describing something like an arcane lock or anker (i.e., either locking something away or closing a door) but no direct instructions on how to break them \n- Asking them about the [[Potion of Water Breathing|potion]], they say that their son may know more about it\n- The [[Gormon|son]] (a wood elf looking to be in his 30s, much paler complexion than his parents and also very different eyes) promptly arrives home \n\t- He says the potion might be something against poison (but that seems to be a lie)\n\t- Reading his thoughts, [[Runa]] finds out that he feels somehow threatened by our presence and seems kinda sketchy. Being asked about the potion and the [[Herathis Mines]], he wants to check something and quickly makes an excuse to leave\n\t- After Sherlock (still in snake form) sees him leave through a window, the party also excuses themselves quickly and follows him into the woods\n\n### Dangerous Paths\n- Following the [[Gormon|son]]’s trail into the woods, [[Asurak]] suddenly falls into a trap\n- Now cautious, we find even more traps, even some very intricate ones that are all equipped with poison\n- Finally, we all manage to get (more or less successfully) past the traps and end up in front of a tiny hut in the woods\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-17-How-to-Lose-Your-Wizard":{"title":"","content":"2022-09-29\n\n### Inside the Mystery Hut\n- Being in need of a rest but not wanting to let our target escape, we decide to let Sherlock, still in snake form (the infamous Snakelock) scout ahead\n- Snakelock quickly gets into the hut, discovering it to be a former hunting cabin that is dusty but has several pairs of footsteps in the dust\n\t- Straight ahead there is a larger room with a (recently) used fireplace, a table, and several books and scrolls\n\t- To the left there is a smaller sleeping chamber with a bed that seems to have been recently used\n- As the hut seems to be empty, we decide to enter and investigate while some members take a rest\n\t- Directly heading for the bed, [[Asurak]] finds a handkerchief and goes to sleep\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] investigates the fireplace and finds remains of burned parchment in there\n\t- [[Runa]] finds a hidden door under the table, and in cooperation with [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], they manage to detect and disarm an alarm spell\n\t- In the books, [[Runa]] finds information on ritual binding (e.g., binding an entity to a place, binding powers to people)\n\t- There is also a very old tome with familiar looking runes that seems to be a translation book but has ripped pages\n\t- Looking at the burned parchment [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] found, [[Runa]] finds that some of them might be the ripped pages from the translation book, but some are also different\n- Opening the trapdoor to investigate downstairs, we find a smaller room that seems to be a laboratory\n\t- On the shelves, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] finds two more bottes of the [[Potion of Water Breathing|mystery potion]], and a [[|bag]] (rust colored, blue cords) that has three fuzzy balls (which emanate some magical aura)\n\t- In a cavity hidden in the floor below a rope, Ruby and Davelor find a small wooden box emanating an aura of illusion magic\n- We all head out of the hut to carefully open the box via mage hands in the open, a [[Deck of Illusions|deck of cards]] is revealed that [[Runa]] after some hesitance picks up and investigates\n\t- It is a deck of cards with some cards missing\n\t- Attempting to do a magic trick with the cards, she accidentally drops on and a fire giant appears in front of her. She combines quickly that it must be an illusion and tries to touch the giant, who is indeed illusory and obeys to her command to dance\n\t- Picking up the card, both the card and the giant vanish\n\t- We now have a [[Deck of Illusions]] with 21 cards left\n\n### Wanted, undead or alive\n- As [[Asurak]] shows the handkerchief that he found to the rest of the group, they decide to try to follow the scent left on it\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] immediately recognizes the handkerchief as his mother [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]’s but doesn’t tell the group\n- Turning into a wolf, Avaaros is able to confirm his mother’s smell but also a rotten smell on it and is able to follow the smell to a nearby area with weirdly assembled stones: a graveyard\n- [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] detects undead just as we are attacked by [[Zombies]] and [[Skeletons]] merging from the graves\n- The zombies and skeletons are not too much of a challenge for the skilled frontline-fighters of the group, but soon two large plant-creatures join the fight and manage to swallow some of the compatriots \n- Unknown to the others, [[Runa]] - who had been contributing to the fight from further away as usual – is ambushed from behind during the fight and is held with a throat to her knife by the [[Gormon|elf]] they had been attempting to follow\n- As the fight subdues, the others realize the hostage situation and try to talk to the [[Gormon|elf]]\n\t- He demands to know what we want and why we asked about the [[Herathis Mines]]\n\t- After some unsuccessful explanation and discussion attempts, the [[Gormon|elf]] summons a portal and takes [[Runa]] with him through it\n\t- As that is happening, the group hears a [[Syrja|female voice]] shouting something like “No, don’t”\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-18-Meet-the-Family":{"title":"","content":"2022-10-06\n\n### That’s a Weirdly Short Kidnapping\n- Runa is taken to the cellar of the nearby hut by the [[Gormon|elf]]\n- Asked about why they are interested in the [[Herathis Mines]], she repeats that they are investigating the sickness and clues seem to lead to the mines\n- The elf, [[Gormon|Gormon Eilir]], explains that he once went there looking for answers too, but the answers found him\n- Asked about these answers, he replies that “we will find out soon enough”\n- He ties up [[Runa]] with the rope, but seems to not be used to this task - she could probably free herself after a while\n- He talks about his master (maybe the [[Chainbreaker]]?) \n\t- they have a place for all of us\n\t- they are the most magnificent creature \n\t- but he doesn’t say a name\n- Gormon, looking for his things, realizes that we have found all of them and gets angry\n- Because [[Runa]] is really bad at lying, he figures out that she has the [[Deck of Illusions]], but a very bitey Sherlock saves them from being taken away\n- [[Gormon]] then leaves to see his master\n\n### Meanwhile at the Cemetery\n- As [[Runa]] was taken away by [[Gormon]], a young wood-elven woman came running into the cemetery shouting to not hurt him: [[Syrja]], Gormon’s sister\n\t- She explains that she was following her brother because he had been acting weird for a couple of months\n\t- He had that mystery sickness but got medicine from a women ([[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]?!) after which he got better but started acting weird\n- They also have another sister, [[People \u0026 Groups/Enren Eillir]], who is sick \n- Syrja also says that she saw her brother bathing in the river\n- Taking Syrja with them, the group uses a Locate spell to find and free [[Runa]] from the cellar\n- The group then decides to go back to the Eilirs’ place and inspect [[Gormon]]’s room\n\n### What happened to Gormon?\n- Back at the Eilirs’ house, [[Ruby]]finds boots that seem to once have been magic in a locked box and a ledger with scribbled notes in a locked drawer\n\t- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] notice that the notes have both [[Gormon]]’s and [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]’s handwriting\n- Borrowing a pearl from [[Syrja]], [[Runa]] identifies the mysterious potions as [[Potion of Water Breathing]] and the fuzzy balls as a [[Bag of Tricks]] that can be used to summon animals \n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] meanwhile talk to [[People \u0026 Groups/Enren Eillir|Enren]], the sick sister, and hear again that Gormon changed a lot after being sick. Enren also says that he was talking in his sleep in agony the night after he got the medicine\n- Demonstrating the bag of tricks, Runa summons a giant goat into the house\n- Runa also reads up on the [[Herathis Mines]]'' history and mine equipment and finds out that the starosta of [[Deastok]], [[Deter McGinneas]], is responsible for the mines\n\n### What will happen to Gormon?\n- Syrja asks the group to not kill her brother but to try to help him because that is not his normal self\n- The group tries to convince her to come along and help in talking him down, at first very unsuccessfully but eventually [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] manages to convince her to at least accompany them to [[Deastok]]\n- She also brings a [[Book of Fairy Tales]] that [[Gormon]] used to read to his sister, in it is a tale of the [[Raven Queen]]’s origin story\n- Saying goodbye to his family, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] learns that his sister is getting worse and is talking in her sleep\n- Everybody leaves for [[Deastok]]\n- On the way, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] further connects to [[Syrja]], we figure out that Syrja hates [[The Bean

group arrives in [[Deastok]] which is a fairly large city (population of 10.000) and enters through the Jeweled Gates manned by crownsguards\n\t- Deastok is a nice city that sees many tourists\n\t- 3 districts: Jeweled Gates (housing the crownsguard barracks), Garden Grounds (mostly residential homes), and Bursar Plaza (Industrial District, shops, inns, etc)\n- Heading to the Industrial District, we see three Inns: [[Tooth \u0026 Nail]], the [[Boar’s Head]], and [[Pinn’s Inn]]\n\t- Ruby, Asurak, Reznak, and Davelor check out the Tooth \u0026 Nail which is empty except from the Dwarven bar women that [[Asurak]] unsuccessfully tries to use his charms on\n\t- In the Boar’s Head, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] meet [[Milton Derstip]]\n\t\t- Hasn’t heard about sickness, but talk to [[Westeron Purthis]] at the [[Temple of Bahamut]] (the Platinum Dragon)\n\t\t- The Mines are about 3 hours to the East, the miners usually stay there during their work, but can be found in the [[Coal’s Row Tavern and Backery]]\n\t\t- For magic weapons, he recommends the [[Dungeon’s Delight]]\n\t\t- Books may be found in the [[Temple of Bahamut]] and the starosta is known to have a semi-public library\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], meanwhile, goes off to a jewelery shop called the [[Golden Crest]] and sells one of the rubies for 5000 goldpieces, he also learns about a magic shop called Spellbound\n\t- Runa talks to a busker running a card game but does not find out more\n- Meeting up again and sharing their intel, the group figures out that Heilar tried to hide having sold the ruby but make him go back and sell another one, as well as buy a pearl for Runa\n- We then head to the [[Dungeon’s Delight]] in search of magical weapons\n\t- They have a [[Berserker's Axe]], a [[Magical Rapier]] and a [[Magical Shield]]\n\t- We buy the Rapier for Tia and the Shield for Heilar, as well as some non-magical armor for Avaaros and Davelor\n- Next, we head to [[Spellbound]]\n\t- They have a lot of different spell scrolls, [[Everlasting Smoke]], a [[Ring of Protection]] (+1 AC), and [[Goggles of Night]], a [[Giantslayer Axe]]\n\t- We buy the [[Giantslayer Axe]] for Asurak, and Sending, Counterspell, and Mage Armor scrolls for Runa\n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] gets some supplies to make healing potions\n- [[Runa]] starts studying the spell scrolls\n- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[Asurak]], and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] head to the [[Coal’s Row Tavern and Backery]] to get some intel from the miners\n\t- They order a round for everyone and sit with some miners\n\t- They hear that there are some [[Ankhegs]] and other beasts in the mine, also some of the weird/corrupted ones\n\t- Many miners transferred to [[Hupperdook]] for coal mining because of the war\n\t- Crownsguard are stationed there to keep the mine safe\n\t- Jobs would be posted at the town’s hall\n\t- They also quickly check out the town’s hall, a stately homestead, but the blackboard only has a posting asking to report any [[Kryn]] activity\n\n### Curiosities and Chaos at the Circus\n- Since there is a circus in town, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[Syrja]] (who stayed with us), [[Runa]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Reznak]] decide to pay it a visit\n- Meanwhile [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], and [[Ruby]] do a pub crawl (and the ruby gets stolen), and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] stays in to finish potions\n- The circus has a big purple and green tent and a few outside tents with a fortune teller (Frivolous Fortunes) and a band (Billy and the Boys)\n- A tall orc bouncer with tribal tattoos collects the entry fees\n- Tia and Syrja get their fortunes told\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] will lose someone close to her in the near future (someone she hasn’t seen in a long time) and she will go swimming in the ocean\n\t- [[Syrja]] will find love but also suffer a great loss forcing her to make a harsh decision\n- In the entry tent, creatures are presented in cages\n\t- A [[Manticore]]\n\t- A [[Sealion|talking Kenku]]\n\t- A Yuan-Ti pureblood\n\t- A giant ape\n\t- A gigantuan snake\n\t- An Aarakokra\n- We start talking to the Kenku, whose name is [[Sealion]]. He sits in a locked glass box and is manacled to the floor with [[Items/Anti-Magic Manacles]]\n\t- He says that he isn’t part of the circus by choice and was captured\n\t- He can do magic (if not for the manacles)\n- The team decides to free him. Sherlock brings a message to [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] who (after trying to inform the others but doesn’t find them in the pub) comes to the circus\n- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sneak into the entry tent during the show while [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[Syrja]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Reznak]] watch the show and create a distraction if needed\n- By reducing [[Sealion]] in size, Runa can free him from the manacles, and after freeing the giant ape who destroys the glas box, the four of them flee the tent\n- However, Tia’s distraction alerts the ring master - and the manticore, the giant snake and the orc bouncer follow and attack us\n- After a harsh fight (during which the giant ape switched sides), we manage to escape with Sealion\n- Everyone meets back at the [[Boar’s Head]], we introduce Sealion, and Heila, Asurak and Ruby admit that the ruby was stolen\n\n### A Ticket to the Mines\n- The next day, we head to the Town Hall to talk to the starosta about a job at the [[Herathis Mines]]\n- We are lead to starosta [[Deter McGinneas]] (a man in his 50s, beer belly, soft face)\n\t- We tell him about our successful job with [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]\n\t- Although there is no open call, he considers hiring us if we provide official documents from [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]\n\t- We promise to bring one\n- We head out, fake a contract, and bring it back\n- We get a contract with the starosta (50pg per Ankheg), a letter allowing us entrance to the mine that we are supposed to show to the work manager [[Eirrendell Kevandor]] (who is crown-appointed and independent from the starosta)\n- We also get a map of the mine (that may not be complete because it is a little old)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.630661794Z","tags":null},"/Sessions/Session-2-Where-Have-All-the-Children-Gone":{"title":"","content":"2022-02-17\n\n![[Pasted image 20221213191652.png]]\n\n\n### Conversation with [[Melvin]] and his wife:\n- There have been a number of unsightly incidents recently, e.g., children disappearing, [[Ankhegs]] and [[Blights]] coming out of the woods\n- Among other things, several children have disappeared\n\t* A total of 7 children, 2 have reappeared: \n\t* [[Sammy Cordison]] (farmer's son), disappeared \u0026 reappeared about 1-1.5 months ago\n\t* [[Sandit]], son of butcher [[Stefan]], disappeared about 3 weeks ago\n* The first victim, [[Vorgal Telsteg]], had been hired to search for the missing children\n\t* He was hired by [[Liza Vorn]], the Idle Master of the temple near the marketplace\n- There is a new [[Lord Roseseeker]] (they call him Rosemaker) who has been in town for about 3-4 weeks now\n\t* He is in the lumber business, seems to be logging a lot\n\t* He has beefed up the Crownsguard, possibly with his own people\n\t* No one really feels like the Crownsguard are effective (although the chief is fine)\n\t* They have encountered the Lord before in the tavern \"Zum Silbernen Beil\".\n\t* [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] knows [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]]], he destroyed the homeland\n\n### Searching for clues in [[Vorgal Telsteg|Telsteg]]'s room\n* We inspect Telsteg's room to look for notes and results of his work\n- Room is quite sparsely furnished, bed, desk, chest\n- In a locked drawer in the desk we find a letter, notes and a key\n\t- The letter is from [[Liza Vorn]] to the [[Federation of Finders]]\n\t- She asks for help in finding the missing children\n\t- Offers 200 gold as a reward\n\t- The notes mainly list names (of the missing children and of people he talked to/wanted to talk to?) \n\t- The key opens the chest where we find 2 gold and a hat\n\t- The hat is a [[Hat of Transformation]] (casts Disguise Self when attuned)\n\n#### Telsteg's Notes\n\u003e * Sammy: -\n\u003e* Rimma: 9\n\u003e* Zara: 5\n\u003e* Sandit: 2?\n\u003e\n\u003e* Liza Vorn\n\u003e* Gustaf\n\u003e* Gila Tolmack\n\u003e* Talked to Anslim, no leads\n\n* [[Gila Tolmack]] is a healer / apothecary\n* [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] knows her\n\n[[Runa]] knows a bit about the [[Federation of Finders]]:\n- Guild from [[Zadash]] (headquarters near the library).\n- Consists of scholars, adventurers, explorers\n- For hire when things need to be found or researched\n- Similar to [[Cobalt Soul]], but more commercial\n- [[Runa]] basically doesn't have a bad opinion of them\n\n### At Liza's temple\n- Temple is located near the marketplace, there are also a butcher, a pharmacy, and a bakery\n- Temple of [[Avandra, the Changebringer]]: nature, trickery, rather positive, change, luck, and freedom, \"rise against the tyranny\"\n- [[Liza Vorn|Liza]] is a half-elf, gray hair, dark skin, white robe, follower of Avandra\n- She has hired the detective [[Vorgal Telsteg]] together with others of the village community (carpenters, butchers, farmers, owner of the silver axe) to find the children.\n- 6 children have disappeared in the last 6 weeks, 2 of whom have reappeared\n\t- First [[Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] (6 y.) -

Since we are a bit short on the money, he offers us a somewhat shady deal in the \"resource-management\" business\n\t\t- he hands us a card with the address of the [[Kaiser's Crown]] bar and says we should go there and order a \"golden water\" to get more information\n\t- returning to [[Spellbound]] a bit later, the owner [[Jonathan Whispwalker]] (human, red coat, white beard) is present as well\n\t\t- they have an [[Amulet of Health]] for 8000 gold pieces and [[Keoghtom's Ointment]] for 4000 gold pieces\n\t\t- he also offers us a deal to get the ointment\n\t\t\t- he urgently needs a satchel of tools that was taken from him and is in the basement of a person with very high status, which is why the crownsguard doesn't help him\n\t\t\t- [[Lionel Roseseeker]] is the one who took (or

cleric\n\n### Scouting out another Roseseeker Manor\n- we go and scout out he house of the Roseseekers here in Deastock in the [[Garden Grounds District]] \n- it is cold outside\n- the Roseseeker estate is a free standing two-story house with an iron gate out front\n\t- there are two uniformed guards at the gate and anothe two at the entrance\n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] turns into a squirrel and heads into the garden with Sherlock the spider\n\t- there are large paw-prints\n\t- thy see a teenage boy looking out the window in the second story and he seems to spot the squirrel\n\t- there are large stained-glass floor-to-ceiling windows next to the front door \n\t- next to the door (and then heading around to the back) is a tea/waiting room, then some servants' quarters, a working/scribing room, and a library/lounge\n\t- at this point, as the squirrel and the spider are at the back of the house, they are spotted by a huge dog (and thus cannot scout anymore)\n\t\t- the dog's bark makes be afraid\n\t\t- we hide in a tree but the dog stays under it and the guards start to notice\n\t\t- [[Asurak]] throws sausages to distract the dog\n\t\t- we use the distraction to

[[Ruby]] (stealthy and can open doors), [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] (can turn into animals), and [[Runa]] (can message and investigate) are supposed to go inside\n\t- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]],

Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] are supposed to go in, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] to support them at the backside of the estate, and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], [[Asurak]], and [[Sealion]] create a distraction in the front \n\n### Sneaky Goat Stuff\n- At the back, [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sneak into the garden unnoticed due to the awesome Pass Without a Trace spell [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] has\n- As they approach the building, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] throws the three balls from the [[Bag of Tricks]] as a distraction for the dog, and a goat, a giant goat, and a rat appear in the garden\n- The three inside people find a window on the side of the house that [[Ruby]] can open, and they enter the servants' quarters unseen\n\n### Distraction gone wrong\n- As a distraction, [[Asurak]] appears and the front of the estate and declares that [[Lionel Roseseeker]]'s son owes him money\n- One of the guards informs [[Lionel Roseseeker]] inside the house, and the group is lead inside to meet hin\n- On the inside they see a crest on the floor of the entrance hall that seems familiar, and there are four portraits of family members (couples), some with dogs\n- [[Lionel Roseseeker]], a human looking to be in his 60s, approaches and leads them to the guest room (at the back of the building) to talk. As they enter, the see a giant goat through the window, and he sends his guard to deal with the situation\n- A halfling woman (looking to be in her 40s) in an intricate uniform bring them tea, but [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] asks for something stronger, so the servant is sent to the cellar to fetch some wine (which is good because she was on her way to the servants' quarters where the others are hiding)\n\n### Sneak, Sneak, Sneak\n- Meanwhile, [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sneak through the kitchen (stealing some new sausages), and through the hall to the entrance hall (seeing a sleeping dog in one of the adjacent rooms)\n- From there, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] hears the servant go down the stairs to the cellar, so they wait for her to come back up again and then sneak downstairs\n- In the cellar, they follow a gangway through wine racks and approach a magically locked door with an inscription in Infernal: \n![[WhatsApp Bild 2023-01-12 um 19.33.03.jpg |400]]\n\n### A Family of Roseseekers\n- Meanwhile, upstairs, [[Asurak]] explains that [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] (junior) owes him money for the job he gave us\n- [[Lionel Roseseeker]] tells the group that is son is usually very true to his word and that he knows a lot about his son's businesses\n- He excuses himself for a while, and then returns with a letter to his son, that we are supposed to deliver when going back to [[Wolfsglenn]]\n\n### The Magic Cellar\n- After solving the riddle of the door (Firstborn is the word), [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] enter the cellar room to find a huge symbol on the ground in the middle of the room with intricate runes around it - [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], through Detect Magic, figures that it has Conjuration magic\n- There also is a cabinet with drawers that give off strong Abjuration vibes, two large chests that are magical, and a faint magical glow from a leather wrapped bag on a table\n- [[Runa]] takes the leather wrap as these are [[Jonathan Whispwalker]]'s tools, and then turns around to find some interesting books:\n\t- two Books on Dunamancy that are chained to a shelf\n\t- A book on the History of Wildemount and specifically the [[Dwendalian Empire]]\n\t- A book on the history of the crown\n\t- A book about the [[Divergence]]\n- With [[Ruby]]'s lockpicking expertise, they manage to free one of the dunamancy books but cannot free the other without making noise\n- [[Ruby]] finds spellcomponents (a pearl necklace, incense, etc.) and takes them\n- So instead, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] turns to the drawers and dispels magic on one of them to get rid of the abjurative effect. [[Ruby]] then successfully picks the lock but upon opening the drawer, a second defense mechanism is triggered and unleashes a fireball that gravely injures [[Runa]]\n- Assuming we are now found, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] quickly heals [[Runa]] and then turns into a polar bear to make a quick exit\n- [[Runa]] quickly (but loudly) frees the second Dunamancy books, and [[Runa]] and [[Ruby]] climb onto the polar bear to ride it out of the cellar\n\n### Awkward Goodbyes\n- Upstairs, [[Lionel Roseseeker]] is just bringing [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Sealion]] to the door as the eruption of the fireball can be heard and he becomes even more suspicious of his guests\n\t- they have two dogs that are keeping his wife company\n- Suddenly, they hear a noise from the cellar and see the white blur of the polar bear running up the stairs, turning right and jumping out of the window\n- [[Lionel Roseseeker]] ushers them out to deal with the intrusion\n\n### Happy Santa Clause\n- [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] quickly stop by [[Spellbound]] to hand the tools to a very happy [[Jonathan Whispwalker]]\n\t- he in turns gives us [[Keoghtom's Ointment]] with 2 doses\n\t- and he promises to have an extra bonus for the expediency the next morning\n- Everyone reconvenes at the Bathtub \n\t- we heal [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]\n-

vulnerable to fire\n\t- Seeing them being attacked, a stranger ([[Asurak]], the Half-Orc Babarian) comes to help\n\t- Together, they fight off the first [[Scarecrow]] (it crumbles down), however, a

is known to be sometimes)\n- The [[Silver Hatchet]] is a small, two-story Tavern, not well-lit, filled with heavy oak tables\n- Inside, there is only two guests and the barkeep (a strong-build, dark-haired, dar-eyed man, „burly fella“)\n- Asked about the missing children (possibly in a somewhat clumsy way that implies he had something to do with it), the barkeep gets very grumpy\n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] recognizes [[Trent]], a close associate (butler/assistant) of [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]], in one of the guests\n\t- He is known to be very loyal and close to his master\n- As [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] try to get [[Trent]] to talk to them outside of the tavern, thing turn a little hostile, they get into a fight with him\n\t- [[Trent]] wears platemail, uses a warhammer (that deals psychic damage)\n\t- A stranger ([[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]) enters the bar and upon seeing the fight, tries to help [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]\n\t- Avaaros turn into a Direwolf\n\t- Trent casts enlarge unto himself\n\t- In the end, all three of them are unconscious\n- [[The Bean

Goo\n- Meanwhile, [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] go see [[Thiobait Dup|Thiobait]], one of the disappeared-but-reappeared kids\n- They find out he is acting creepy and weird since he came back

what happened to him (and they believe him)\n- Going to Sammy’s room, we find him sitting on the bed, looking too pale for someone who spends a lot of time outdoors\n\t- His room (toys etc.) does not

information but refers them to the starosta [[Emmet Anslim]] who can be found in the town hall close to the crownsguard’s house\n- He also says that [[Trent]] lives in Roseseeker Manor which is also close to the crownsguard’s house\n\n### Meetup at the Golden Comb\n- Our party reunites in the [[Golden Comb Tavern \u0026 Inn|Golden Comb]] only to find out that all of us have gotten into some kind

[[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] to the apothecary to retrieve it\n- [[Melvin]] the barkeep tells us that [[Alma]], the young daughter of woodworker [[Cleff Shorkrus]] has been sick supposedly also poisoned for a long time but has recovered recently\n- [[Runa]], [[Reznak]], and [[Asurak]] go to talk to Cleff\n\n### Shadows in the Apothecary\n•\t[[The Bean

[[Reznak]], and [[Asurak]] arrive at Cleff’s woodworking shop and upon meeting him notice that he had been present in the [[Silver Hatchet]] earlier\n- Cleff (after being unsuccessfully intimidated) does not cooperate and only says that he got the medicine for his daughter [[Alma]] from the apothecary\n- [[ Asurak]], however, noticed that he is trying to hide that he got it from a person who is not supposed to work there\n- Cleff seems confident in himself and there seems to be more to him than appears at a first glance\n- He finally tells us to go to the apothecary to find out for ourselves\n- On the way to the apothecary, we are attacked by another [[Shadow]] in a small alleyway\n- During the fight, the shadow looks at Reznak for a moment but then attacks Asurak\n- We kill the

We see no guards inside, but suits of armor and a painting of him with a large black dog\n- [[Lord Roseseeker|Lord Bering Roseseeker]] is a rather pale human, probably late 30s or early 40s with brown hair and beard and piercing blue eyes.

Trying to calm him down but also sensing that he carries guilt within him, Liza said that “everything has a price” and “we do what we have to”. Fearing that she knows the truth, Cleff panicked and attacked her\n- Afraid that Cleff might be a danger to others, Runa and Avaaros collect the others and head towards Cleff’s house\n\n### Intervention at Cleff’s\n- Arriving at [[Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]]’s, we find that there is light in the house and in the workshop, but no one is around\n- Ruby and Reznak investigate the workshop and find that it is a bit ransacked as if someone was searching for something. One of Cleff’s ledgers, the one detailing open bills to collect is missing (Cleff is looking to collect his money?)\n- In the house, we see Cleff’s wife sitting at the desk, seemingly distraught an crying\n- As we knock, she lets us enter. [[Alma]] is with her grandparents and Cleff is upstairs. She has just found out about his secret\n- Heading upstairs, we find Cleff in the bedroom with a dagger next to him, looking desperate\n- His wife convinces him to tell us his secret: \n\t- When his daughter had been sick for a long time and nobody had been able to find a cure, he was approached by the [[Hag]] who offered him a deal – the cure for [[Alma]]’s sickness in exchange for him bringing her other children \n\t- #question She said that [[Alma]]’s soul was not tethered to her body anymore and that’s what made her sick (was she responsible for that?) \n\t- Cleff took [[Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] first and was relieved to see that he returned quickly. The hag said that he was too old and she needed another child. This time, he only had to open the window to [[Rima Pur|Rima]]’s room and then some monster took her\n\t- But he didn’t take any of the other children\n- After some discussions about what to do, we offer Cleff a deal: We have to tell the authorities in the morning (which we will likely not do) but if he is gone by then, that is none of our business. So he should disappear with his family and spend his life making up for what he did\n- Leaving the house, particulary [[Asurak]] is not happy with this decision. He heads back to the tavern alone and starts drinking\n\n### Book Club, the second attempt\n- Runa and Avaaros head to Liza’s again to tell her that we found [[Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]] and that she does not have to worry anymore (but no details) \n- Moreover, asked about [[Ankhegs]], Liza has a book on woodland creatures including them\n\t- Large insects, they burrow tunnels\n\t- Live in swarms\n\t- Hunt by using pressure sense\n\t- Acidic spit or spray\n\t- Not particularly vulnerable or resistant to anything\n\t- Have a chitinous armor, best hit in the belly\n- Liza treated one of the woodworkers, [[Irvin Grey]], after an attack of [[Ankhegs]]\n\n### When fight club goes wrong\n- Interrogating a grumpy [[Asurak]] in the tavern, we learn that he hears a voice in his head telling him to fight and to kill. The voice seems to originate from his [[Berserker's Axe]] (magic weapon, cursed?)\n- Hoping that sparring helps him get rid of the aggression, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] agree to fistfight him\n- After being hit by Tia first, Asurak looses control and attacks Thia with his axe\n\t- We then intervene in the fight and let Asurak fall asleep. While he sleeps, Avaaros hides his axe and the others hold him\n\t- Waking up, Asurak fights to be reunited with his weapon\n\t- We figure out that the axe is cursed and that curses can only be broken by remove curse or by creating distance causing disattunement (100 ft.?) \n- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] brings the weapon to [[Liza Vorn|Liza]]\n- [[Asurak]] still wants to know where it is.

The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.634661812Z","tags":null},"/Spells/Mind-Sliver":{"title":"","content":"\nYou drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range.

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\n\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\n\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\n\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.\n\n**Improved Minor Illusion.** When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.634661812Z","tags":null},"/Spells/Sending":{"title":"","content":"\nYou send a short Message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with you are familiar.

On a failed save, it pursues the course of Action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of Action can continue for the entire Duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the Subject finishes what it was asked to do.\n\nYou can also specify Conditions that will trigger a Special activity during the Duration. For example, you might suggest that a Knight give her Warhorse to the first Beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't preformed.\n\nIf you or any of your Companions damage the target, the spell ends.","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T13:02:34.634661812Z","tags":null},"/Spells/Tashas-Mind-Whip":{"title":"","content":"\nYou psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range.
