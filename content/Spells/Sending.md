You send a short Message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with you are familiar. The creature hears the Message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables Creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your Message.

You can send the Message across any distance and even to Other Planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the Message doesn't arrive.
