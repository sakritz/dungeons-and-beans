## General Information
- cures all diseases and conditions
- we found them in  the [[Places/Herathis Mines]] - likely brewed by [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] and [[People & Groups/Gormon]]

## Current Wielder
- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] each had one but used them to cure their skin opacity problem after the fight with the [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]] - we don't have them anymore
