### A weird awakening
- After realizing that everyone except [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] had the same dream, the party decides that some research is due before facing the [[Herathis Mines]] again, so they want to visit the villages lorekeeper for some answers
- Before going there, Heilar frees Davelor and Asurak of their curses
- In a quiet moment, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] shows [[Runa]] the diary of his mother [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] that is mostly written in Abyssal
	- First part is written in common and describes normal day-to-day stuff like getting supplies but also the fight with [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] about whether or not to fight to protect the forest (that led him to leave)
	- After that, more and more Abyssal creeps in
	- She describes brewing potions, crafting spellfocuses, making magic ink and other magic items
	- There are also arcane symbols in Abyssal
	- One of the [[Potion of Water Breathing|potions]] described seems similar to what we found in the [[Hag]]’s hut and after the dream
	- The ink used to write the diary is not normal ink but doesn’t seem to possess magical properties anymore
	- (we think maybe she got possessed by something because to the best of our knowledge she did not know Abyssal)
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] still believes that his mother wouldn’t hurt us and that we need to save her
- [[Runa]] promises to do her best to help and also does not tell the rest of the party about the diary

### Meeting the Lorekeeper
- Still early in the morning, the party heads over to [[Lyra and Fhaonik Eillir]]'s place
- They are an elderly elven couple, very friendy 
- Telling them about our dreams and the runes, we find a very old-looking book that has very similar runes describing something like an arcane lock or anker (i.e., either locking something away or closing a door) but no direct instructions on how to break them 
- Asking them about the [[Potion of Water Breathing|potion]], they say that their son may know more about it
- The [[Gormon|son]] (a wood elf looking to be in his 30s, much paler complexion than his parents and also very different eyes) promptly arrives home 
	- He says the potion might be something against poison (but that seems to be a lie)
	- Reading his thoughts, [[Runa]] finds out that he feels somehow threatened by our presence and seems kinda sketchy. Being asked about the potion and the [[Herathis Mines]], he wants to check something and quickly makes an excuse to leave
	- After Sherlock (still in snake form) sees him leave through a window, the party also excuses themselves quickly and follows him into the woods

### Dangerous Paths
- Following the [[Gormon|son]]’s trail into the woods, [[Asurak]] suddenly falls into a trap
- Now cautious, we find even more traps, even some very intricate ones that are all equipped with poison
- Finally, we all manage to get (more or less successfully) past the traps and end up in front of a tiny hut in the woods
