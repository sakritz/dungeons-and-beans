### The Miner’s Office 
- Inspecting the door in the other side of the bridge, the Night Knights find that it is much smaller and not made for the wagon to go through but instead seems to hide a room
- The wagon tracks continue around a corner
- [[Ruby]] picks the lock of the door and reveals a room behind it with some drawers, cupboards, shelves and a desk: the office of the mine
- In the desk, [[Runa]] finds old and fragile parchments, a ring with a key, and some notes
	- The parchments contain a order to broaden the mines as well as a receipt for 20.000 pounds of [[Whitestone]]
	- [[Whitestone]] is a city in [[Tal’Dorei]] known for the stone of the same name. Whitestone is a material that has special properties and is used to make [[Whitestone|Residuum]] (ratio of 3:1 from Whitestone to Residuum) which is a material that can substitute material components for spell
	- #question Whitestone is very rare and usually not found here in this area
	- A pound of Residuum is worth about 15.000 gold pieces
	- The parchments also reveal that the mine was generally referred to as a coalmine, thus probably hiding the presence of Whitestone in there
	- The receipt has a sigil at the bottom that [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] recognizes as that of the [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] family => he probably knows about the Whitestone
- There is also some boxes in the room in which [[Ruby]] finds a locked crate. However, when picking the lock, the crate is empty
- Runa, however, looks at a mirror in the room that is opposite of Ruby and the crate. Inspecting is, she doesn’t find anything interesting at first but when she puts her hand against it on a hunch, her hand enters the [[mirror]]
	- With [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]]s help, [[Runa]] sees that “behind” the mirror, there is a mirror version of the room they are in
	- Tia and Runa enter and find two bottles of reddish liquid in the crate in the mirror room, which are a [[greater healing potion]] and a [[superior healing potion]]
	- To better understand the mirror room, Tia takes a pen and breaks another one
	- Trying to leave, Tia and Runa then find that the mirror has become solid and doesn’t let them pass
	- Being able to make a connection to the others via the message cantrip, Runa instructs them to also break the pen and as the rooms are the same again, the mirror can be passed again
	- The mirror basically contains a pocket dimension but doesn’t seem to work when moved to another location, so we leave it there

### Meeting (and Fighting) the Ankheg Queen
- Following the wagon tracks further into the mine, the Night Knights arrive at the head of another cavern-like room, on top of an elevator-like wooden construction
- In the cavern, they encounter another group of [[Ankhegs]], 4 [[Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankhegs]], 2 “normal” Ankhegs and an [[Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]]
- In a group effort involving an enlarged Ruby, bear Avaaros and lots of hits and acid sprays, the Night Knights finally manage to kill all of the Ankhegs
- Asurak take the head of the Ankheg Queen, which seems to be not fully grown yet
- In the cave, we also find some more [[Whitestone]], more egg sacks in a pool of water, and some mining instruments

### We Made a Mushroom-Friend
- While following the tunnels ahead and arguing about [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]s intentions, we suddenly hear a sound behind us
- Inspecting its source, Avaaros (in dog form) discovers a very small, mushroom-like person
- Carefully approaching it, we strike up a (mental) conversation with the seemingly very intelligent person
	- We learn that he has been following us for some time and doesn’t like noise
	- He has also seen the previous mine’s foreman (a dwarf) being killed in a fight by a “big and hairy” person (likely his boss) and then everyone left
	- He says that there is much more [[Whitestone]] in the mine
	- His family is living further below and are larger so they can’t come out
	- He can emit spores that charm people (currently everyone except Runa and Ruby are charmed and very protective of our little friend)
- Avaaros in dog form with Sherlock on his back is then taken to meet his family
	- There are many and large mushroom-people down in the cave
	- They are called [[Mikonoids]] or [[Mikonoids|Spore Clan]]
	- There is a lot of Whitestone down there
	- There is one exit of the mine left if we follow the tunnels but there are also more Ankhegs up ahead
- After this encounter we head back to the previous cavern to take a long rest
