### Our Plan is No Plan, Part 2
- We again go over different options for breaking into the Roseseeker manor
- We decide to do it during the day because it might be less conspicuous if we are caught
- [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] are supposed to go in, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] to support them at the backside of the estate, and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], [[Asurak]], and [[Sealion]] create a distraction in the front 

### Sneaky Goat Stuff
- At the back, [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sneak into the garden unnoticed due to the awesome Pass Without a Trace spell [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] has
- As they approach the building, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] throws the three balls from the [[Bag of Tricks]] as a distraction for the dog, and a goat, a giant goat, and a rat appear in the garden
- The three inside people find a window on the side of the house that [[Ruby]] can open, and they enter the servants' quarters unseen

### Distraction gone wrong
- As a distraction, [[Asurak]] appears and the front of the estate and declares that [[Lionel Roseseeker]]'s son owes him money
- One of the guards informs [[Lionel Roseseeker]] inside the house, and the group is lead inside to meet hin
- On the inside they see a crest on the floor of the entrance hall that seems familiar, and there are four portraits of family members (couples), some with dogs
- [[Lionel Roseseeker]], a human looking to be in his 60s, approaches and leads them to the guest room (at the back of the building) to talk. As they enter, the see a giant goat through the window, and he sends his guard to deal with the situation
- A halfling woman (looking to be in her 40s) in an intricate uniform bring them tea, but [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] asks for something stronger, so the servant is sent to the cellar to fetch some wine (which is good because she was on her way to the servants' quarters where the others are hiding)

### Sneak, Sneak, Sneak
- Meanwhile, [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sneak through the kitchen (stealing some new sausages), and through the hall to the entrance hall (seeing a sleeping dog in one of the adjacent rooms)
- From there, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] hears the servant go down the stairs to the cellar, so they wait for her to come back up again and then sneak downstairs
- In the cellar, they follow a gangway through wine racks and approach a magically locked door with an inscription in Infernal:

### A Family of Roseseekers
- Meanwhile, upstairs, [[Asurak]] explains that [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] (junior) owes him money for the job he gave us
- [[Lionel Roseseeker]] tells the group that is son is usually very true to his word and that he knows a lot about his son's businesses
- He excuses himself for a while, and then returns with a letter to his son, that we are supposed to deliver when going back to [[Wolfsglenn]]

### The Magic Cellar
- After solving the riddle of the door (Firstborn is the word), [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] enter the cellar room to find a huge symbol on the ground in the middle of the room with intricate runes around it - [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], through Detect Magic, figures that it has Conjuration magic
- There also is a cabinet with drawers that give off strong Abjuration vibes, two large chests that are magical, and a faint magical glow from a leather wrapped bag on a table
- [[Runa]] takes the leather wrap as these are [[Jonathan Whispwalker]]'s tools, and then turns around to find some interesting books:
	- two Books on Dunamancy that are chained to a shelf
	- A book on the History of Wildemount and specifically the [[Dwendalian Empire]]
	- A book on the history of the crown
	- A book about the [[Divergence]]
- With [[Ruby]]'s lockpicking expertise, they manage to free one of the dunamancy books but cannot free the other without making noise
- [[Ruby]] finds spellcomponents (a pearl necklace, incense, etc.) and takes them
- So instead, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] turns to the drawers and dispels magic on one of them to get rid of the abjurative effect. [[Ruby]] then successfully picks the lock but upon opening the drawer, a second defense mechanism is triggered and unleashes a fireball that gravely injures [[Runa]]
- Assuming we are now found, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] quickly heals [[Runa]] and then turns into a polar bear to make a quick exit
- [[Runa]] quickly (but loudly) frees the second Dunamancy books, and [[Runa]] and [[Ruby]] climb onto the polar bear to ride it out of the cellar

### Awkward Goodbyes
- Upstairs, [[Lionel Roseseeker]] is just bringing [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Sealion]] to the door as the eruption of the fireball can be heard and he becomes even more suspicious of his guests
	- they have two dogs that are keeping his wife company
- Suddenly, they hear a noise from the cellar and see the white blur of the polar bear running up the stairs, turning right and jumping out of the window
- [[Lionel Roseseeker]] ushers them out to deal with the intrusion

### Happy Santa Clause
- [[Runa]], [[Ruby]], and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] quickly stop by [[Spellbound]] to hand the tools to a very happy [[Jonathan Whispwalker]]
	- he in turns gives us [[Keoghtom's Ointment]] with 2 doses
	- and he promises to have an extra bonus for the expediency the next morning
- Everyone reconvenes at the Bathtub 
	- we heal [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]
- The next morning, everyone finds another bean from the [[Bag of Beans]] in their boots
