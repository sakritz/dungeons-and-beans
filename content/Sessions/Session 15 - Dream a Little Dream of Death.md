(One Shot / Side Quest)

### What the F?
- The Night Knights go to bed after encountering the Rakshasa and soon wake up in a nightly mountain scenery
- [[Heilar]] is not there
- They also soon notice that all their magical items are gone
- Looking at the land around them, [[Davelor]] recognizes this to be near the town of [[Deastok]], about two days of travel from where they went to bed
- Climbing a tree, [[Ruby]] sees city lights in the distance
- There is also a path leading into the opposite direction
- The group decides to go to the village

### Of Rocks and Rocs
- Suddenly, a gargantuan bird is flying nearby and seems to stalk the group
- Guessing that hiding will not help, [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]]] throws a rock at the bird and the [[Roc]] attacks
	- Quickly, multiple people are going down in the fight
	- [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]] sees gates in the nearby mountain and tells the group to flee there
	- Due to a combination of [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]] distracting the bird and then playing dead, [[Asurak]] throwing distracting sausages, and [[Runa]]’s spell slowing the bird, everyone makes it to the gates

### Another Creepy Mine
- The gates have an inscription in Elvish saying [[Herathis Mines]]
- The locked door opens upon [[Davelor]]’s touch
- Inside, there is creepy fog and [[Davelor]] has the weird urge to follow the fog
- Also, there is more [[Whitestone]] but it glows and lights up in Davelors hands (but not the old Whitestone in Tia’s bag)
- The group follows the mine, takes and elevator down and sees strange runes on the Whitestone that are written in Abyssal and seems to be of abjurative, protective nature (maybe not let Davelor touch it?)
- [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] (in wolf form) also smells his mother
- Crossing a chasm and following a spiralling path into a pit with more fog at the bottom, the group finally reaches a river that seems to spring from a chamber behind three stone archways and flows into east/west directions
- Still smelling his mother, [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] goes into the river and into the chamber
- The water is warm for [[Davelor]] but cold for the others
- In the chamber, [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] sees his mother on a platform above the water, [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] is humming and writing in a book
- After being addressed by Avaaros, Cecilia touches his face and then turns into water and attack
- More [[Water Elementals]] appear and start to overpower and drown us
	- Weirdly, [[Runa]] hits one over the point of being dead but it still isn’t
- As we are drowning, a symbol lights up on the platform [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] was on and cracks appear in it

### Wakey wakey
- Waking up from the nightmare, the group quickly realized that they all had the same dream 
- They are back and all the magic items are also back
- Runa, Ruby, and Avaaros find [[Potion of Water Breathing|bottles with blueish/greyish liquid]] in their pockets (similar to what they had also found in the [[Hag]]’s loot)
- [[Runa]] sketches the symbol and the runes to the best of her ability
