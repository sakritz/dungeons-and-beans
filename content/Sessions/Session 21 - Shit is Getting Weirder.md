### Level 2: Careful Exploration
- We discuss how to move forward: Should we move straight down or explore the mines some more? In the end, most people want to explore and we agree to be careful and try to avoid fights while doing so
- We send Sherlock scouting ahead to avoid any [[Phase Spiders|spider]] business, he finds more and more webs toward the elevator area and a small wooden box in a larger main hall
- Ruby tries to open it but we finally burn it open and find two vials in it, one healing potion and another [[Elixir of Health|red potion]] we don’t know
- In the next room, Sherlock is killed by some spider-y thing, so we avoid the room
- Moving on, [[Ruby]] is attacked by something with tentacles: a [[Roper]]
- After the fight, we find another box with three vials, but one is destroyed in the opening process We retain another health potion and another one of the red potions that [[Runa]] identifies as a [[Elixir of Health]] (cures diseases and conditions)

### Level 3: Deja-Vu
- We descend to the third level, which we recognize from our dream
- As we discuss what to do, a weird dwarven figure starts approaching us, moving in a weird dragging way
	- It does not respond to any communication and just slowly drags closer
	- [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]] and [[Davelor]] eventually get charmed
	- [[Asurak]] tries to touch it and takes psychic damage
	- There is a weird string attached to the dwarf’s back that is impervious to damage
	- Through trial-and-error we finally figure out that it is very afraid of fire
	- A huge amorphous blob (like gelatin, with faces swimming on the inside) appears - an [[Oblex]]
	- It is able to incapacitate people and steal their memories, but we manage to kill it
- [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] finds an [[Ioun Stone of Leadership]] that we give to [[Davelor]]
- We take a short rest and then head down the spiral tunnel from our dream where we are greeted by mist
