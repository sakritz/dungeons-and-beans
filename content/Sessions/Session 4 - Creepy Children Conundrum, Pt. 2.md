### Meeting Sammy
- After defeating the animated scarecrows, [[Runa]], [[Reznak]], and [[Asurak]] knock on the door of the Cordinson’s farm house
- Sammy’s parents, [[Kauldon Cordison]] and [[Lorina Cordison]] (both gnomes) open the door and once the missing children are mentioned, they compliantly invite us in
	- They explain that [[People & Groups/Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] was the first one taken, he vanished from his room during the day (about 6 weeks ago) and was nowhere to be found
	- 2 days later he reappeared in front of the house
	- They say he is “half back”, he was once a very lively child but is now quiet and doesn’t go out anymore
	- They took him to [[People & Groups/Liza Vorn]] and to the apothecary (where some herb mix was offered) but nothing helped
	- [[People & Groups/Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] told them he doesn’t remember what happened to him (and they believe him)
- Going to Sammy’s room, we find him sitting on the bed, looking too pale for someone who spends a lot of time outdoors
	- His room (toys etc.) does not seem used at all
- It is hard to get [[People & Groups/Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] to talk, he seems shy and frightened, but he tells us a little bit
	- “no one can help us”
	- “once she takes you, it’s too late”
	- “she’s mean and dark and evil”
- Sammy’s parents can’t think of any similarities between the children except for their age
- They don’t know much about [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker]] except that he is in town for about 6 months and that his workers have begun taking down trees in the closeby forest
- Outside, [[Asurak]] inspects the remains of the [[Scarecrow]] and notices that the straw is not dry (as would be normal) but is slimy/gooey

### Interlude at the Silver Hatchet
- [[Runa]], [[Reznak]], and [[Asurak]] return to the [[Places/Silver Hatchet]] only to find the remnants of the fight but none of their friends
- They briefly talk to the barkeep who tells them about three strangers attacking an innocent patron
- Asking him about the missing children, he doesn’t seem to have much information but refers them to the starosta [[People & Groups/Emmet Anslim]] who can be found in the town hall close to the crownsguard’s house
- He also says that [[People & Groups/Trent]] lives in Roseseeker Manor which is also close to the crownsguard’s house

### Meetup at the Golden Comb
- Our party reunites in the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb]] only to find out that all of us have gotten into some kind of fight
- We exchange information
- [[Ruby]] breaks down unconscious and seems to have been poisoned by the goo
- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] knows that silver bell flower might help and goes with [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] to the apothecary to retrieve it
- [[People & Groups/Melvin]] the barkeep tells us that [[People & Groups/Alma]], the young daughter of woodworker [[People & Groups/Cleff Shorkrus]] has been sick supposedly also poisoned for a long time but has recovered recently
- [[Runa]], [[Reznak]], and [[Asurak]] go to talk to Cleff

### Shadows in the Apothecary
•	[[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] and [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] arrive at the apothecary finding the door open but the shop empty, [[People & Groups/Gila Tolmack|Gila]] nowhere to be found
•	A [[Monsters & Foes/Shadow]] appears and attacks them
•	They escape out into the open, the shadow follows but seems to be more vulnerable (i.e., concrete) in the sunlight
•	They kill the [[Monsters & Foes/Shadow]], it disperses without a trace
•	Returning to investigate the apothecary, they find the door suddenly locked
•	Inside, still no trace of [[People & Groups/Gila Tolmack|Gila]] (but they take some healing potions and the silver bellflower for Ruby)
•	They inform the crownsguard of the open but abandoned apothecary but again, the door is mysteriously locked

### Interrogating [[People & Groups/Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]]
- [[Runa]], [[Reznak]], and [[Asurak]] arrive at Cleff’s woodworking shop and upon meeting him notice that he had been present in the [[Places/Silver Hatchet]] earlier
- Cleff (after being unsuccessfully intimidated) does not cooperate and only says that he got the medicine for his daughter [[People & Groups/Alma]] from the apothecary
- [[ Asurak]], however, noticed that he is trying to hide that he got it from a person who is not supposed to work there
- Cleff seems confident in himself and there seems to be more to him than appears at a first glance
- He finally tells us to go to the apothecary to find out for ourselves
- On the way to the apothecary, we are attacked by another [[Monsters & Foes/Shadow]] in a small alleyway
- During the fight, the shadow looks at Reznak for a moment but then attacks Asurak
- We kill the shadow, find the apothecary locked and return to the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb]]
