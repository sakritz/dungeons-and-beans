### Making a Plan
- the group gets rooms in the [[Boar’s Head]] in [[Deastok]] where [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] is placed in a bathtub
- [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], who is finally being himself again after the fight, says that he fell into darkness and felt suspended
- [[Runa]] uses Detect Thoughts on [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] to see if it is similar to [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]'s condition
	- she sees loosely connected memories flying past: taking water out of a creek, tending to [[Gormon]], she also sees scenes from their common dream
	- after that, there is not much more

### Let's Brew a Potion
- we split up to get ingredients for [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] to brew another [[Elixir of Health]] for [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] ([[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]]) and get information about the [[Chainbreaker]] and the [[Aboleth]] (the rest of the gang) while Cecilia, Tia, and Gormon stay at the inn
- Runa and Avaaros try to find the ingredients needed
	- [[Potions & Lotions 1]] does not have all of them, especially some Golden something is very rare and might only be available in [[Zadash]] and [[Rexxentrum]]
	- in [[Spellbound]], we talk to [[Asher Whispwalker]] (the owner's nephew, a half-elf), they also don't have all the ingredients but might have a magical item with similar powers, we should come back later
	- in [[Dungeon’s Delight]] we talk to the owner [[Henry]] who has an [[Elixir of Health]] for 5000 gold pieces. Since we are a bit short on the money, he offers us a somewhat shady deal in the "resource-management" business
		- he hands us a card with the address of the [[Kaiser's Crown]] bar and says we should go there and order a "golden water" to get more information
	- returning to [[Spellbound]] a bit later, the owner [[Jonathan Whispwalker]] (human, red coat, white beard) is present as well
		- they have an [[Amulet of Health]] for 8000 gold pieces and [[Keoghtom's Ointment]] for 4000 gold pieces
		- he also offers us a deal to get the ointment
			- he urgently needs a satchel of tools that was taken from him and is in the basement of a person with very high status, which is why the crownsguard doesn't help him
			- [[Lionel Roseseeker]] is the one who took (or illegitimately kept) the tools after Jonathan installed an arcane locking mechanism for a box and some carved stone statues in his home and then accidentally left the tools there
			- the tools are in a dark red leather pouch with an emblem of the shop
			- we can get a bonus if the bring back the tools within 24 hours

### Meanwhile in the Temple
- [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], [[Ruby]], [[Sealion]], and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] head to the [[Temple of Bahamut]] to learn more about the [[Chainbreaker]]
- they meet [[Indries Iselda]], an older human and the cleric on duty
- he doesn't know anything about the [[Chainbreaker]] but tells them that the [[Arcane Gates]] prevent Gods from coming to the material plane
- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] prays with the cleric

### Scouting out another Roseseeker Manor
- we go and scout out he house of the Roseseekers here in Deastock in the [[Garden Grounds District]] 
- it is cold outside
- the Roseseeker estate is a free standing two-story house with an iron gate out front
	- there are two uniformed guards at the gate and anothe two at the entrance
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] turns into a squirrel and heads into the garden with Sherlock the spider
	- there are large paw-prints
	- thy see a teenage boy looking out the window in the second story and he seems to spot the squirrel
	- there are large stained-glass floor-to-ceiling windows next to the front door 
	- next to the door (and then heading around to the back) is a tea/waiting room, then some servants' quarters, a working/scribing room, and a library/lounge
	- at this point, as the squirrel and the spider are at the back of the house, they are spotted by a huge dog (and thus cannot scout anymore)
		- the dog's bark makes be afraid
		- we hide in a tree but the dog stays under it and the guards start to notice
		- [[Asurak]] throws sausages to distract the dog
		- we use the distraction to run, the dog chases after but with a mind sliver, we get out

### How to not have a plan 
- we try to make a plan how to best break into the house
- we decide that not all of us should go in
	- [[Ruby]] (stealthy and can open doors), [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] (can turn into animals), and [[Runa]] (can message and investigate) are supposed to go inside
	- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], [[Asurak]], and [[Sealion]] stay outside as a distraction and rescue team
	- we brainstorm some possible distractions like a performance, a fight, an earthquake, and a fire
	- in the end, we agree to not really have a plan except that the guard should be distracted
