### An Interrupted Night
- The Night Knights attempt to take a long rest in the office in the cave
- Because the rest of the party are still very much charmed by the mushroom people, [[Ruby]] and [[Runa]] decide to be part of the watches and also keep an eye on their friends
- The first watch goes by uneventful for [[Tia]] and [[Runa]]
- During the second watch, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] notices some noises in front of the locked office door
- Due to some loud noises from the sleeping party members, the noises seem to come closer, and vibrations are felt
- We quickly wake up and prepare for an [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg]] attack: Tia opens the locked door to make space for fighting, we position ourselves
- Three Ankhegs appear: one burrowing inside the office, two outside on the space before the chasm
- We manage to kill them off relatively unscathed but more Ankhegs (of the corrupted kind) can be heard and seen coming up from the chasm
- Figuring that there is no way of getting that long rest, we decide to make a run for it
- The [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankegs]] do not immediately chase after us but stop to feast on the [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg]] cadavers first

### On the Run
- We make our way through the tunnels towards to exit
- Not feeling immediately chased anymore, we slow down
- In the tunnels, we find a wooden alcove that seems to have been a workspace
	- In a locked box that can be opened with the key we found in the office before, Ruby and Heilar find a ring and a healing potion; Heilar wears the ring; it is a [[Items/Ring of Spell Storing]]
	- In another, non-locked box, Runa finds residue of a green power: [[Items/Whitestone|Residuum]]. She scrapes together what she can find of it and puts it in a vial

### She’s a real [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]]
- Sneaking ahead, Heilar and Ruby (together with a glowing Sherlock) come up to a large cavern in which they see two shapes, one in Ankheg shape and size and one much larger
- The Night Knights discuss how to best approach this situation but unfortunately take too long and are noticed by the [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs]]
- In the cavern, there are five [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankhegs]] and the gigantic adult [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]]
- In a long and strenuous fight including legendary actions and legendary saves as well as Ruby, Davelor, and Tia briefly go down, the Night Knights finally manage to kill all of the Ankhegs

### There’s Some Corruption Going On
- Asurak and Davelor take off the Ankheg Queen’s head and take it with them
- Inspecting her body, we find that she is covered in a strange, oily substance that makes her seem iridescent
- The same oily substance can also be found in a river close to her original position in the cave. The oily substance seems to originate from a place upstream that is beyond the cavern and the available tunnels
- In the river, there are again some egg sacks, most of them empty, the others seemingly damaged
- The [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg Queen]] looks like the [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Corrupted Ankhegs]]
- We also saw/heard her eating one of the normal Ankhegs when we entered the cave
- We don’t know what exactly is going on with the corruption but 
	- Davelor senses something magical/holy going on?
	- Runa has heard of corruption before but would need to do further research (e.g., in Zadash)
- We decide to call it a day, take the elevator in the cavern up to the top and take a rest in the forest above
