### That’s a Weirdly Short Kidnapping
- Runa is taken to the cellar of the nearby hut by the [[Gormon|elf]]
- Asked about why they are interested in the [[Herathis Mines]], she repeats that they are investigating the sickness and clues seem to lead to the mines
- The elf, [[Gormon|Gormon Eilir]], explains that he once went there looking for answers too, but the answers found him
- Asked about these answers, he replies that “we will find out soon enough”
- He ties up [[Runa]] with the rope, but seems to not be used to this task - she could probably free herself after a while
- He talks about his master (maybe the [[Chainbreaker]]?) 
	- they have a place for all of us
	- they are the most magnificent creature 
	- but he doesn’t say a name
- Gormon, looking for his things, realizes that we have found all of them and gets angry
- Because [[Runa]] is really bad at lying, he figures out that she has the [[Deck of Illusions]], but a very bitey Sherlock saves them from being taken away
- [[Gormon]] then leaves to see his master

### Meanwhile at the Cemetery
- As [[Runa]] was taken away by [[Gormon]], a young wood-elven woman came running into the cemetery shouting to not hurt him: [[Syrja]], Gormon’s sister
	- She explains that she was following her brother because he had been acting weird for a couple of months
	- He had that mystery sickness but got medicine from a women ([[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]?!) after which he got better but started acting weird
- They also have another sister, [[Enren EIllir]], who is sick 
- Syrja also says that she saw her brother bathing in the river
- Taking Syrja with them, the group uses a Locate spell to find and free [[Runa]] from the cellar
- The group then decides to go back to the Eilirs’ place and inspect [[Gormon]]’s room

### What happened to Gormon?
- Back at the Eilirs’ house, [[Ruby]]finds boots that seem to once have been magic in a locked box and a ledger with scribbled notes in a locked drawer
	- [[Runa]] and [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] notice that the notes have both [[Gormon]]’s and [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]’s handwriting
- Borrowing a pearl from [[Syrja]], [[Runa]] identifies the mysterious potions as [[Potion of Water Breathing]] and the fuzzy balls as a [[Bag of Tricks]] that can be used to summon animals 
- [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] and [[Heilar]] meanwhile talk to [[Enren EIllir|Enren]], the sick sister, and hear again that Gormon changed a lot after being sick. Enren also says that he was talking in his sleep in agony the night after he got the medicine
- Demonstrating the bag of tricks, Runa summons a giant goat into the house
- Runa also reads up on the [[Herathis Mines]]'' history and mine equipment and finds out that the starosta of [[Deastok]], [[Deter McGinneas]], is responsible for the mines

### What will happen to Gormon?
- Syrja asks the group to not kill her brother but to try to help him because that is not his normal self
- The group tries to convince her to come along and help in talking him down, at first very unsuccessfully but eventually [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]] manages to convince her to at least accompany them to [[Deastok]]
- She also brings a [[Book of Fairy Tales]] that [[Gormon]] used to read to his sister, in it is a tale of the [[Raven Queen]]’s origin story
- Saying goodbye to his family, [[Heilar]] learns that his sister is getting worse and is talking in her sleep
- Everybody leaves for [[Deastok]]
- On the way, [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]] further connects to [[Syrja]], we figure out that Syrja hates [[Heilar]]
