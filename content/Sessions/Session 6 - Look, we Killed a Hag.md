### Clearing the hut
- Waking up in the [[Monsters & Foes/Hag]]’s hut, we inspect its insides and surroundings a bit more
- Looking at the [[Monsters & Foes/Flesh Golem]], [[People & Groups/Gila Tolmack|Gila]] must have been dead for quite a while (so who was posing as Gila after that?)
- [[Runa]] is able to translate [[Ruby]]’s tattoo that she got after taking a dagger called [[Items/Fate's Grip]] from the hut: it says FOREVER BOUND and IN FATE’S GRIP in Abyssal
- Inspecting her books, nothing seems unusual, mostly books in abyssal or sylvan about herbs and stuff. [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] takes one larger tomes that looks expensive
- We take the [[Monsters & Foes/Hag]]’s head as evidence (but leave the bodies in the hut) 

### Announcing the victory
- We head back with [[People & Groups/Callie]] to reunite her with her parents
- In front of the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb]], a large crowd including crownsguard has gathered
- We inform the head of the crownguard, [[People & Groups/Captain Algar]], about the [[Monsters & Foes/Hag]]. He is inclined to believe us, but doesn’t completely
- He takes us to [[People & Groups/Emmet Anslim]], the starosta in the town hall
	- Small, skinny, blond hair slicked back, noble silk clothes in blue and gold
	- The starosta is quite unfriendly and dismisses us soon

### Discussing hags with [[People & Groups/Liza Vorn|Liza]]
- We inform Liza of what happened
- She seems to know quite a lot about [[Monsters & Foes/Hag]]s, in one of her tomes, it says that sometimes hags abduct children and turn them into hags (but the children are usually babies and turn into hags 13 years later)
- She asks us to deliver the information about [[People & Groups/Vorgal Telsteg]]’s death to the [[People & Groups/Federation of Finders]] of we get to Zadash
- She tells us that [[People & Groups/Gila Tolmack|Gila]] was a bit strange recently (e.g., did not know stuff she should have known)

### Celebrating in the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb]]
- Back at the Golden Comb, [[Asurak]] starts a drinking competition with [[People & Groups/Gustaf]], Teddy (a giant ogre that is working for Gustav), and some other patrons of the bar: we lose
- We also play some truth or dare and learn a bit about each other
	- [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]’s necklace now has a pattern on it and seems to represent his path or destiny
	- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] tried to kill himself and was saved by the [[People & Groups/Raven Queen]] which is why he is her follower
	- [[Ruby]] flirts with Gustaf to steal his money on a dare from Davelor
	- Tia beats Asurak in an arm wrestling match on his dare
