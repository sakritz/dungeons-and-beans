### Setting
* 836 pD (post Divergence)
* [[Places/Dwendalian Empire]]
	* currently at war with the [[Places/Kryn Dynasty]] but there is a ceasefire
* End of the year, dark and grey days
* We are starting in [[Places/Wolfsglenn]] near the [[Places/Cyrengreen Forest]]

### The Inciting Incident
* We are in the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn]]
	* barkeeper is [[People & Groups/Melvin]] (halfling, red hair, red beard, rather strong)
- We hear a ruckus in a room
- There is a dead person lying on the floor in the room
	- the neck is dislocated
	- bruises that seem to come from the inside
	- conspicuously inconspicuous person: man, ca 35, well-groomed, but inconspicuous
- There are no footprints in the room, something flees out the window (no one sees it, presumably it was the shadow)
- The [[Crownsguard]] arrives, [[Dalee]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros]] are basically suspicious and are not allowed to leave Wolfsglenn 
- Melvin tells that the dead man is Mr. [[People & Groups/Vorgal Telsteg|Telsteg]] who has been there for about 5 days and was assigned by [[People & Groups/Liza Vorn|Liza]] to do some investigation
- Some are thinking of leaving the Inn and staying at the Inn "Zum roten Apfel" with  [[Salem]] instead.

### Attack in the alley
- [[Dalee]] and [[Reznak]] (in the backpack) leave the Inn and make their way to the red apple
- In the alley next door they are attacked by a [[Monsters & Foes/Shadow]]
	- The shadow travels through the body causing necrotic damage that leaves bruises just like [[People & Groups/Vorgal Telsteg]]'s
	- Melee attacks seem to have little effect on the shadow
	- We all join the fight
	- The shadow is undead
	- Magic missile damages the shadow a lot
	- The shadow flees
* [[Dalee]] is dead
- In order not to be caught with a corpse again, we decide to bury the body in the forest
* [[Runa]] creates a distraction with Minor Illusions of cries for help from the direction of the marketplace to keep the patrolling Crownguard busy
* The rest make their way into the forest with the body


### Burial and Ambush in the Forest
- [[Reznak]], [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] make it to the forest and bury the body
- On the way back they notice movement and discover a [[Monsters & Foes/Blights|Vineblight]] attacking them
	- [[Monsters & Foes/Blights|Vineblights]] are living entanglements of vines, they do not bode well, are they related to dark magic?
	- There is also a [[Monsters & Foes/Blights|Twigblight]] and a [[Monsters & Foes/Blights|Needleblight]] coming along and joining the fight
	- Long and dangerous fight, all are seriously injured
	- Finally the Blights can be defeated, among other things with fire
- Everyone makes their way back to the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb Tavern]]
