### Conversation with [[Melvin]] and his wife:
- There have been a number of unsightly incidents recently, e.g., children disappearing, [[Ankhegs]] and [[Blights]] coming out of the woods
- Among other things, several children have disappeared
	* A total of 7 children, 2 have reappeared: 
	* [[Sammy Cordison]] (farmer's son), disappeared & reappeared about 1-1.5 months ago
	* [[Sandit]], son of butcher [[Stefan]], disappeared about 3 weeks ago
* The first victim, [[Vorgal Telsteg]], had been hired to search for the missing children
	* He was hired by [[Liza Vorn]], the Idle Master of the temple near the marketplace
- There is a new [[Lord Roseseeker]] (they call him Rosemaker) who has been in town for about 3-4 weeks now
	* He is in the lumber business, seems to be logging a lot
	* He has beefed up the Crownsguard, possibly with his own people
	* No one really feels like the Crownsguard are effective (although the chief is fine)
	* They have encountered the Lord before in the tavern "Zum Silbernen Beil".
	* [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] knows [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]]], he destroyed the homeland

### Searching for clues in [[Vorgal Telsteg|Telsteg]]'s room
* We inspect Telsteg's room to look for notes and results of his work
- Room is quite sparsely furnished, bed, desk, chest
- In a locked drawer in the desk we find a letter, notes and a key
	- The letter is from [[Liza Vorn]] to the [[Federation of Finders]]
	- She asks for help in finding the missing children
	- Offers 200 gold as a reward
	- The notes mainly list names (of the missing children and of people he talked to/wanted to talk to?) 
	- The key opens the chest where we find 2 gold and a hat
	- The hat is a [[Hat of Transformation]] (casts Disguise Self when attuned)

#### Telsteg's Notes
> * Sammy: -
>* Rimma: 9
>* Zara: 5
>* Sandit: 2?
>
>* Liza Vorn
>* Gustaf
>* Gila Tolmack
>* Talked to Anslim, no leads

* [[Gila Tolmack]] is a healer / apothecary
* [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] knows her

[[Runa]] knows a bit about the [[Federation of Finders]]:
- Guild from [[Zadash]] (headquarters near the library).
- Consists of scholars, adventurers, explorers
- For hire when things need to be found or researched
- Similar to [[Cobalt Soul]], but more commercial
- [[Runa]] basically doesn't have a bad opinion of them

### At Liza's temple
- Temple is located near the marketplace, there are also a butcher, a pharmacy, and a bakery
- Temple of [[Avandra, the Changebringer]]: nature, trickery, rather positive, change, luck, and freedom, "rise against the tyranny"
- [[Liza Vorn|Liza]] is a half-elf, gray hair, dark skin, white robe, follower of Avandra
- She has hired the detective [[Vorgal Telsteg]] together with others of the village community (carpenters, butchers, farmers, owner of the silver axe) to find the children.
- 6 children have disappeared in the last 6 weeks, 2 of whom have reappeared
	- First [[Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] (6 y.) - reappeared
	- [[Rima Pur]] (5 yrs.), the parents are farmers
	- [[Zara Crannock]] (8 years), her father is [[Eliah]], the Blacksmith
	- [[Sandit]], the son of Stefan the butcher
	- [[Thiobait Dup]] (7 years), son of the weaver - resurfaced
	- Finally, [[Moira Waal]] disappeared about 8 days ago, parents are farmers
- The children seem to have disappeared from bed at night some of the time
- It is not clear if [[Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] and [[Thiobait Dup|Thiobait]] know anything
- They want us to help, the reward is free again
- Liza can tell us some of the names on the note
	- [[Emmet Anslim]] is the starosta of [[Wolfsglenn]], seems rather uninterested in solving the children's disappearance
	- [[Gustaf]] is the owner of the general store, he is a strange fellow
- Asked about [[Shadows]] Liza says that shadows are supposed to be the remaining souls and they did lose some souls

### Avaaros talks to Gila Tolmack
- People reported strange occurrences
- [[Zara Crannock|Zara]] was at the apothecary just before disappearing, picking up herbs for her sick father (and put them on the tab)
- Offers healing tinctures for the friendship price of 20 gold

### [[Davelor]] talks to [[Gustaf]]
- Strange guy, has to be bribed to talk
- No similarities between the missing children or their families
	- Many seem to live on the outskirts of the village?
	- [[Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] (and possibly also [[Thiobait Dup|Thiobait]]) seem changed since reappearing, quieter
