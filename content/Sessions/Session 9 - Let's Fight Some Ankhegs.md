### Preparations
- After casting the Find Familiar spell last night, [[Runa]] discovers that Sherlock is her familiar
- She learns how to look through his eyes and thereby sees her scars for the first time
- Transfixed by the view, she stares at herself for a long time
- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] and [[Ruby]] send their letters to their families

### Meeting the Lumberjacks
- Arriving at the lumberjack camp, the Night Knights see a series of log cabins, a large tent, and a shack
- Entering the tent, which doubles as a dining hall and construction office, they see two people standing over a map: [[People & Groups/Jonas]] and [[People & Groups/Irvin Grey|Irvin]]
- Asking them about the [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg]] encouters, they learn that some Ankhegs are smaller and faster than the regular ones
- In the last Ankheg attack being the ponds, one of the lumberjacks, [[People & Groups/Check Chheu]], was taken by them (seemingly alive)

### Into the Woods
- Making their way into the woods, the Night Knigts are unbothered for the first hours of the journey. [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], and [[Ruby]] are taking the front, while [[Runa]] is sitting on [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]'s shoulders and scouting through Sherlock 
- They encounter some fallen-over trees which seem to have been dug up and try to lure out the [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs]] at this point, but nothing happens

### The Bear and the Ankhegs
- After another few hours of travel, the Night Knights arrive in the area where the last reported attack has happened
- Avaaros spots a wounded bear on a clearing and heads over, when suddenly some [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs]] (1 large and two smaller ones) appear and attack
- Another two Ankhegs appear from a tunnel below
- The group manages to fight and kill the five Ankhegs but also take some hits
- Inspecting the hole left by the Ankhegs, [[Asurak]] decised to jump in there
- There is a manmade cave/room about 4 metres below
- Two more Ankhegs attack and are also killed
- Inspecting the cave, we find that it was the beginning of a mine. There are two collapsed tunnel entrances, one has a stream of water
- We decide to take a rest in the cave
