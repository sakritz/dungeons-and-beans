### Arrival in Deastok
- The group arrives in [[Places/Deastok]] which is a fairly large city (population of 10.000) and enters through the Jeweled Gates manned by crownsguards
	- Deastok is a nice city that sees many tourists
	- 3 districts: Jeweled Gates (housing the crownsguard barracks), Garden Grounds (mostly residential homes), and Bursar Plaza (Industrial District, shops, inns, etc)
- Heading to the Industrial District, we see three Inns: [[Places/Tooth & Nail]], the [[Places/Boar’s Head]], and [[Places/Pinn’s Inn]]
	- Ruby, Asurak, Reznak, and Davelor check out the Tooth & Nail which is empty except from the Dwarven bar women that [[Asurak]] unsuccessfully tries to use his charms on
	- In the Boar’s Head, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] meet [[People & Groups/Milton Derstip]]
		- Hasn’t heard about sickness, but talk to [[Westeron Purthis]] at the [[Temple of Bahamut]] (the Platinum Dragon)
		- The Mines are about 3 hours to the East, the miners usually stay there during their work, but can be found in the [[Places/Coal’s Row Tavern and Backery]]
		- For magic weapons, he recommends the [[Places/Dungeon’s Delight]]
		- Books may be found in the [[Temple of Bahamut]] and the starosta is known to have a semi-public library
	- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], meanwhile, goes off to a jewelery shop called the [[Places/Golden Crest]] and sells one of the rubies for 5000 goldpieces, he also learns about a magic shop called Spellbound
	- Runa talks to a busker running a card game but does not find out more
- Meeting up again and sharing their intel, the group figures out that Heilar tried to hide having sold the ruby but make him go back and sell another one, as well as buy a pearl for Runa
- We then head to the [[Places/Dungeon’s Delight]] in search of magical weapons
	- They have a [[Items/Berserker's Axe]], a [[Magical Rapier]] and a [[Magical Shield]]
	- We buy the Rapier for Tia and the Shield for Heilar, as well as some non-magical armor for Avaaros and Davelor
- Next, we head to [[Places/Spellbound]]
	- They have a lot of different spell scrolls, [[Everlasting Smoke]], a [[Ring of Protection]] (+1 AC), and [[Goggles of Night]], a [[Items/Giantslayer Axe]]
	- We buy the [[Items/Giantslayer Axe]] for Asurak, and Sending, Counterspell, and Mage Armor scrolls for Runa
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] gets some supplies to make healing potions
- [[Runa]] starts studying the spell scrolls
- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[Asurak]], and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] head to the [[Places/Coal’s Row Tavern and Backery]] to get some intel from the miners
	- They order a round for everyone and sit with some miners
	- They hear that there are some [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs]] and other beasts in the mine, also some of the weird/corrupted ones
	- Many miners transferred to [[Places/Hupperdook]] for coal mining because of the war
	- Crownsguard are stationed there to keep the mine safe
	- Jobs would be posted at the town’s hall
	- They also quickly check out the town’s hall, a stately homestead, but the blackboard only has a posting asking to report any [[Kryn]] activity

### Curiosities and Chaos at the Circus
- Since there is a circus in town, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[People & Groups/Syrja]] (who stayed with us), [[Runa]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Reznak]] decide to pay it a visit
- Meanwhile [[Asurak]], [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]], and [[Ruby]] do a pub crawl (and the ruby gets stolen), and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] stays in to finish potions
- The circus has a big purple and green tent and a few outside tents with a fortune teller (Frivolous Fortunes) and a band (Billy and the Boys)
- A tall orc bouncer with tribal tattoos collects the entry fees
- Tia and Syrja get their fortunes told
	- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] will lose someone close to her in the near future (someone she hasn’t seen in a long time) and she will go swimming in the ocean
	- [[People & Groups/Syrja]] will find love but also suffer a great loss forcing her to make a harsh decision
- In the entry tent, creatures are presented in cages
	- A [[Manticore]]
	- A [[Sealion|talking Kenku]]
	- A Yuan-Ti pureblood
	- A giant ape
	- A gigantuan snake
	- An Aarakokra
- We start talking to the Kenku, whose name is [[Sealion]]. He sits in a locked glass box and is manacled to the floor with [[Items/Anti-Magic Manacles]]
	- He says that he isn’t part of the circus by choice and was captured
	- He can do magic (if not for the manacles)
- The team decides to free him. Sherlock brings a message to [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] who (after trying to inform the others but doesn’t find them in the pub) comes to the circus
- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] sneak into the entry tent during the show while [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]], [[People & Groups/Syrja]], [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]], and [[Reznak]] watch the show and create a distraction if needed
- By reducing [[Sealion]] in size, Runa can free him from the manacles, and after freeing the giant ape who destroys the glas box, the four of them flee the tent
- However, Tia’s distraction alerts the ring master - and the manticore, the giant snake and the orc bouncer follow and attack us
- After a harsh fight (during which the giant ape switched sides), we manage to escape with Sealion
- Everyone meets back at the [[Places/Boar’s Head]], we introduce Sealion, and Heila, Asurak and Ruby admit that the ruby was stolen

### A Ticket to the Mines
- The next day, we head to the Town Hall to talk to the starosta about a job at the [[Places/Herathis Mines]]
- We are lead to starosta [[People & Groups/Deter McGinneas]] (a man in his 50s, beer belly, soft face)
	- We tell him about our successful job with [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]
	- Although there is no open call, he considers hiring us if we provide official documents from [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]
	- We promise to bring one
- We head out, fake a contract, and bring it back
- We get a contract with the starosta (50pg per Ankheg), a letter allowing us entrance to the mine that we are supposed to show to the work manager [[Eirrendell Kevandor]] (who is crown-appointed and independent from the starosta)
- We also get a map of the mine (that may not be complete because it is a little old)
