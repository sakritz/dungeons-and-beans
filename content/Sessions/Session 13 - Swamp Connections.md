### Tactical Decisions
- Waking up the next morning, the Knight Nights discuss their next steps
	- [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] demanded all Ankhegs to be killed – so what would happen if Ankhegs showed up after we reported success?
	- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]]’ objectives are to protect the mushroom people but also to get revenge (and ideally kill) Roseseeker
	- Can we talk to [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] and hide that we know about the [[Whitestone]]?
	- What is up with the corruption in the river?
- Finally, we decide to first find out where the river and corruption are coming from and see if that helps in deciding what to do about [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]

### Upstream We Go
- Apparently, [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] has wandered off during the night – seemingly on his own volition – in a northern direction
- We decide to use Sherlock to follow the river: Sherlock gets transformed into a poisonous snake that is able to swim through the river, and using an earring from Avaaros, both he and Heilar are able to track Sherlock’s movements in the river
- We follow Sherlock for about 3 hours in a northern/north-western direction (we get about 3,5 miles)
	- The water is not comfortable for Sherlock but he does not take damage
	- However, the river is difficult to follow upstream because of many slim passages
	- Finally, we end up in a swamp with muddy (and already weird-smelling) water and sickly animals

### Fuckin’ Lights
- Trying to track the smell of the corrupted water, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] in wolf-form wanders into the swamp and is attacked by something in the water
	- We fight a [[Drowned Maiden]], her drowned companion and some [[Will-o'-Wisps]]
	- Drowned maiden grapples many people with her hairs
	- All of them are resistant to non-magical damage
	- [[Will-o'-Wisps]] reduce everyone to 0 hitpoints on a failed con-save
- Finally, after a long struggle with several of the Night Knights going down, we manage to kill them
- Going through the pockets of the drowned people, we see that the clothes seem of Elven make, in earth tones
	- The [[Drowned Maiden]] seems to have been a druid, we find a stone statue that was her druidic focus
	- She seems a little mutated/corrupted
	- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] recognizes the two bodies as people from his village which is further north and promptly goes into shock

### The Night Knights at Night
- To rest for the night, [[Runa]] conjures up a tiny hut
- During the watches, the different pairs share some more personal information with each other
	- [[Ruby]] shares with Avaaros that she escaped from prison once and was betrayed by her friends (who didn’t help her in prison) and boyfriend (who had another girlfriend when she got out of prison)
	- Reznak and Aurak get some bonding time in which [[Reznak]] shares that he spend most of his life in an attic and dreamed of attending a bard’s college – he also hopes that it may be possible to revive his brother
	- [[Asurak]] shares that he doesn’t like being angry but swore that he will find the murderer of his forster parents (who were killed by a band of bandits whose leader he is pursuing)
	- [[Runa]] shares her upbringing and her secret parchment with [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]
