### Book Club or Fight Club?
- Having some time to spend until we head towards the woods in the morning, people are discussing what to do
- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] (who feels guilty for accidentally hitting her unconscious in the last fight) head to [[Liza Vorn|Liza]]’s to see if she has more information on [[Ankhegs]]
- The others head to the lumberjacks to find a fight for Asurak and possibly talk to [[Jonas]] about the [[Ankhegs]]

### Attack in the temple
- Arriving in the temple, [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] find the room empty and the doors ajar, but [[Liza Vorn|Liza]] is nowhere to be seen
- Heading through the open door into her private chambers, they find Liza unconscious n the ground with strangling marks on her throat
- After healing and waking her, Liza is confused and upset
	- [[Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]] came to her in a very distressed state, he seemed to want to run or hide and talked about [[Gila Tolmack|Gila]]. Trying to calm him down but also sensing that he carries guilt within him, Liza said that “everything has a price” and “we do what we have to”. Fearing that she knows the truth, Cleff panicked and attacked her
- Afraid that Cleff might be a danger to others, Runa and Avaaros collect the others and head towards Cleff’s house

### Intervention at Cleff’s
- Arriving at [[Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]]’s, we find that there is light in the house and in the workshop, but no one is around
- Ruby and Reznak investigate the workshop and find that it is a bit ransacked as if someone was searching for something. One of Cleff’s ledgers, the one detailing open bills to collect is missing (Cleff is looking to collect his money?)
- In the house, we see Cleff’s wife sitting at the desk, seemingly distraught an crying
- As we knock, she lets us enter. [[Alma]] is with her grandparents and Cleff is upstairs. She has just found out about his secret
- Heading upstairs, we find Cleff in the bedroom with a dagger next to him, looking desperate
- His wife convinces him to tell us his secret: 
	- When his daughter had been sick for a long time and nobody had been able to find a cure, he was approached by the [[Hag]] who offered him a deal – the cure for [[Alma]]’s sickness in exchange for him bringing her other children 
	- #question She said that [[Alma]]’s soul was not tethered to her body anymore and that’s what made her sick (was she responsible for that?) 
	- Cleff took [[Sammy Cordison|Sammy]] first and was relieved to see that he returned quickly. The hag said that he was too old and she needed another child. This time, he only had to open the window to [[Rima Pur|Rima]]’s room and then some monster took her
	- But he didn’t take any of the other children
- After some discussions about what to do, we offer Cleff a deal: We have to tell the authorities in the morning (which we will likely not do) but if he is gone by then, that is none of our business. So he should disappear with his family and spend his life making up for what he did
- Leaving the house, particulary [[Asurak]] is not happy with this decision. He heads back to the tavern alone and starts drinking

### Book Club, the second attempt
- Runa and Avaaros head to Liza’s again to tell her that we found [[Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]] and that she does not have to worry anymore (but no details) 
- Moreover, asked about [[Ankhegs]], Liza has a book on woodland creatures including them
	- Large insects, they burrow tunnels
	- Live in swarms
	- Hunt by using pressure sense
	- Acidic spit or spray
	- Not particularly vulnerable or resistant to anything
	- Have a chitinous armor, best hit in the belly
- Liza treated one of the woodworkers, [[Irvin Grey]], after an attack of [[Ankhegs]]

### When fight club goes wrong
- Interrogating a grumpy [[Asurak]] in the tavern, we learn that he hears a voice in his head telling him to fight and to kill. The voice seems to originate from his [[Berserker's Axe]] (magic weapon, cursed?)
- Hoping that sparring helps him get rid of the aggression, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] agree to fistfight him
- After being hit by Tia first, Asurak looses control and attacks Thia with his axe
	- We then intervene in the fight and let Asurak fall asleep. While he sleeps, Avaaros hides his axe and the others hold him
	- Waking up, Asurak fights to be reunited with his weapon
	- We figure out that the axe is cursed and that curses can only be broken by remove curse or by creating distance causing disattunement (100 ft.?) 
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] brings the weapon to [[Liza Vorn|Liza]]
- [[Asurak]] still wants to know where it is. As he heads to sleep, we have Sherlock watch him for the night
- Before heading to sleep, [[Runa]] casts find familiar and [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] write letters to their families
