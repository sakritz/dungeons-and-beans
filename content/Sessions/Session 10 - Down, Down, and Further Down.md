### What Kind of Mine is This?
- After taking a rest in the cave, the Night Knights inspect the cave some more
- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] had already discovered some old pickaxes and shovels as well as a mysterious type of stone during their night shift
	- The stone is shiny, foggy, and seemingly naturally occurs in this cave
	- No one has seen this kind of stone before
	- It could be valuable
	- Tia and Asurak break some of the some from the cave and take them
- Perhaps this is what [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] is actually after and why he sent us to clear the forest?
	- There are some other mines in the areas, for example the [[Places/Herathis Mines]] a bit north, which are platinum mines
	- Runa knows that mines can only be exploited with the express permission of the Crown - so it would make sense if [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] wants to keep the mine a secret

### Deeper into the Mine
- [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] scout one of the two tunnel entrances for the group
	- They climb some rubble and find tracks
	- Following them, they enter a cave in which they discover cocoons – seven empty and three still developing ones
	- Avaaros cuts open one cocoon and discovers them to be [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs|Ankheg]] cocoons
	- They alert the group
- Everyone makes their way deeper into the mine
	- Unfortunately, the tunnel collapses behind them as they cross the cave-in; now, the only way forward is deeper into the mines
	- After killing the three cocooned [[Monsters & Foes/Ankhegs]], the group goes further
	- [[Ruby]], who is taking the lead, accidentally sets off a trap in the entrance to another cave – she is hit by rocks as she sets of a trap-wire
	-In this cavern, there is a large door towards which the tracks are leading
	- Close to the door, there are two dead bodies (one almost a skeleton)
	- Inspecting the bodies, Tia finds a notebook with a note on one of them
- The note seems to bear instructions in form of a riddle on how to open the door. There are 9 levers on the door and the riddle reveals which two must be pulled
![[Stuff/Pasted image 20221216192244.png]]
- After successfully solving the riddle and opening the door (yay, teamwork), the group finds a wagon and further tracks
- Tia and Avaaros (with help from Asurak and Davelor) ride the wagon down the tracks but they derail at a junction
- Taking the left path, the group enters another cavern which contains a questionably stalwart bridge (for the tracks) leading to yet another door
- [[Ruby]] successfully makes it across the bridge and secures a rope for others
- When [[Runa]] follows, she is attacked from above
 

### Fighting in the Dark
- As Runa is crossing the bridge, something falls from above and wraps around her head:  a [[Monsters & Foes/Darkmantle]]
- The creature causes her to be blind and unable to speak or breathe while also emitting magical darkness
- Reznak manages to free Runa by putting the creature to sleep but is attacked and incacitated by another one of these creatures
- Being unable to see the creatures in the darkness, the group has a hard time hitting them
- During the fight, Ruby admits that her dagger  may be cursed
- But through a combination of lucky attacks, sleep spells (which dissolve the darkness) and brave attacks, the group finally kills all four of these Darkmantles
- Everyone successfully crosses the bridge
