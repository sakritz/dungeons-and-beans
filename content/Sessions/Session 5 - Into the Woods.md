### Party Counsil
- The whole group meets up in the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb]]
- We exchange what we have encounter and discuss what to do next
- [[Ruby]] has been healed and is fine again
- [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]’s head wound disappeared, he says he had a weird dream, and asks the barkeep for a Blacksmith (which are the Crannochs)

### Another missing child
- While we are trying to decide what to do next, [[People & Groups/Melvin]] storms into the Inn and is looking for his daughter, [[People & Groups/Callie]] (5 years old, halfling child, light brown hair, very smart and independent)
- We investigate her room, the window is open, but there are no signs of what happened
- Her brother also did not see or hear anything during the night

### Into the woods
- We head into the woods, it is still very early and dark outside
- We find some snatched twigs pointing us some directions (confirmed by a bird that [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] talks to)
- The woods are hard to navigate, due to very thick fog
- Suddenly, [[Monsters & Foes/Shadow]] appear and attack us, we kill one of them, the other disappears
- As the fog then lifts we see a hut on a small clearing in the woods
- A female creature is on the hut’s roof, she then crawls down there
- It is a [[Monsters & Foes/Hag|Night Hag]]: Long black hair, piercing yellow eyes, her fingers are too long
- She sends out [[Monsters & Foes/Flesh Golem]]s (looking like too many people smashed together, with multiple arms, legs, two head) to attack us 
- The golems are made out of 5 bodies in total, the 4 missing kids (i.e., [[People & Groups/Zara Crannock|Zara]], [[People & Groups/Moira Waal|Moira]], [[People & Groups/Sandit]], and [[People & Groups/Rima Pur|Rima]]) and [[People & Groups/Gila Tolmack|Gila]]
- After an intense fight in which [[Runa]] almost dies and gets horribly scarred, we manage to kill her
- And then we went into her hut and found [[People & Groups/Callie]] alive and apparently unharmed and could free her 
- And we found very interesting stuff in her hut
	- A 
- We take a long rest in the hut
