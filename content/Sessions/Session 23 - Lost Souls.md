### Reconnecting
- the group tries to deal with the aftermath of the fight
	- [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] doesn't leave [[Syrja]]'s side
	- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] investigates the [[Aboleth]]'s body and finds that this is also a slightly changed version, it is more slimey and shimmery than they usually are. He also remembers that they usually contaminate water around them
	- the stone plateau in the cavern (which cracked in during the fight) in cracked in in a way as if a vacuum below cracked it in
- asked about what she still remembers, [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] recounts her memories
	- she ran out of ink and went to get supplies, amongst others she took water from a well (*corrupted water???*)
	- later she found writings in her diary that she didn't remember writing
	- something communicated with her through the writing in the diary
	- she doesn't remember much else
- [[Gormon]] says that he also doesn't have many memories, he doesn't even know about being able to cast spells or kidnapping [[Runa]]

### Soul Searching
- trying to figure out why [[Syrja]] couldn't be revivified, [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] explains that her soul wasn't where is is supposed to go after death 
	- usually he reaches out to the soul in that place an tries to convince it to come back
	- but her soul was not there
- [[Runa]] also the spell being cast and knows that there was nothing wrong with the spell

### Cave Diving
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] turns into a tiger shark to explore the pools of water in the cavern
	- they do not have a floor but instead lead into an underwater cave system
	- there are two tunnels, one finally gets too narrow to pass through
	- the other one continues for a very long time and finally leads to a pond near [[Deastok]]

### Sealing Off the Cavern
- after some discussions, the group decides to leave the cavern through the water tunnel instead of going back through the mine
- [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] seals off the entrances to the cavern both from the mine and throughthe water with stone shaping
- we dive through the tunnel to the pond
- ecause there are three sick people but only two elixirs of healt, [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] after some discussions volunteers to not receive an [[Elixir of Health]] of health and instead stay in a bathtub until another one can be brewed by [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]
- [[Runa]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] take the [[Elixir of Health]] and are healed from the skin condition
- everyone heads back to [[Deastok]]
