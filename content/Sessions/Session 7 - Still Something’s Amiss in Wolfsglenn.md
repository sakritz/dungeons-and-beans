### Inspecting the Loot
- We take a look at the things that we tooks from the [[Hag]]’s hut
	- [[Fate's Grip]], a magical dagger
	- [[Toothed Bracelet]]: a silver bracelet with intertwined teeth (=> Avaaros attuned to it)
	- [[Ring of Mind Shielding]]: a ring decorated with what looks like a brain. It shields from mind reading, scrying, etc., traps the sould of its bearer if killed and if it contains a souls, it can to talk to the bearer (=> Asurak attuned to it)
	- A jar with an eye floating in it
	- A [[Potion of Water Breathing|bottle with blueish fluid]]: not a healing potion, tasted a bit salty
	- A [[Bag of Beans]] (9, unexpectedly heavy) => everyone gets one bean

### Back to interrogating [[Cleff Shorkrus|Cleff]]
- We visit Cleff again to find out who was selling him the healing potion for his daughter
- This time, we go for a more charming approach
- He is not happy to see us and doesn’t want to talk
- Detecting his thoughts, [[Runa]] gathers that he is nervous and is trying to hide something 
- We lie to him about a second [[Hag]] targeting his daughter
	- “that fucking bitch”
- He says that he is in big trouble and no one can help him
- [[Runa]] gathers that he know his daughter is save but has a secret about having done something bad that he wouldn’t tell anyone
- Even being charmed by [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]], he does not yield

### Inspecting the apothecary again
- Looking for more clues in the apothecary, we find that it is not locked anymore
- We loot some stuff (Runa got 50gp worth of incense)
- [[Asurak]] finds a hidden backspace / living areas that seems to not have been lived in for quite a while
	- [[Runa]] finds a diary/salesbook from [[Gila Tolmack|Gila]] listing sales and places to find herbs and stuff
	- The last entry (which was before the children started disappearing) said she wanted to go into the wooks to collect bell flowers at a clove of pine trees (Runa takes the book)

### An audience with [[Lord Roseseeker]]
- Determined to find out more about Lord Roseseeker, we head towards Roseseeker Manor
- It is a large estate surrounded by a fence and secured by guards
- We decide to officially pay a visit, introduce ourself and offer our service ([[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] turns into a dog to avoid being recognized by [[Trent]])
	- We are lead in by the guards, one of them is [[Steve]], a rather young and approachable human guard
	- The manor is a two-story building which is currently being renovated but looks impressive
	- We see at least two guards at the gates, two at the entrance and three walking the perimeters, all seem experienced and skilled
- We are led into the manor and into Roseseeker’s study. We see no guards inside, but suits of armor and a painting of him with a large black dog
- [[Lord Roseseeker|Lord Bering Roseseeker]] is a rather pale human, probably late 30s or early 40s with brown hair and beard and piercing blue eyes. He is wearing a white blouse of nice cloth but also sturdy boots for going into the woods. He seems fit
- Upon introducing ourselves to Roseseeker and telling him about the [[Hag]], [[Runa]] attemps to cast a minor illusion of the hag and is attacked and stopped by [[Erama]], Roseseeker’s bodyguard
- Erama is a non-binary elf with a light grey ponytail and an all-black outfit (none of us noticed him until he moved)
- Reznak also notices that [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] has a skull on a chain on his belt that he hides, the skull seems to be of a child
- Upon offering our services, [[Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] hires us to clear an area of the woods of the [[Ankhegs]] that have been attacking his workers for 50 gold for each of us
- We get a [[Map of Roseseeker's Forest|map of the woods]] ([[Runa]] has it) and are told that the foreman [[Jonas]] could tell us more about the [[Ankhegs]] which partly seemed unusual
- [[Trent]] generally doesn’t trust us (especially as we brought [[Tia Thunderstep|Tia]] who was part of the barfight)

### Shopping at [[Gustaf]]’s
- On the way back, we stop at Gustaf’s general store for some shopping
- Runa got a cloak and two books, one on the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and an infernal cook book
- Tia got some armor
- Reznak got a flute
- Asurak was looking for a fight club but there doesn’t seem to be one, so he is going to fight Tia and Avaaros?
