### Inside the Mystery Hut
- Being in need of a rest but not wanting to let our target escape, we decide to let Sherlock, still in snake form (the infamous Snakelock) scout ahead
- Snakelock quickly gets into the hut, discovering it to be a former hunting cabin that is dusty but has several pairs of footsteps in the dust
	- Straight ahead there is a larger room with a (recently) used fireplace, a table, and several books and scrolls
	- To the left there is a smaller sleeping chamber with a bed that seems to have been recently used
- As the hut seems to be empty, we decide to enter and investigate while some members take a rest
	- Directly heading for the bed, [[Asurak]] finds a handkerchief and goes to sleep
	- [[Davelor]] investigates the fireplace and finds remains of burned parchment in there
	- [[Runa]] finds a hidden door under the table, and in cooperation with [[Ruby]] and [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]], they manage to detect and disarm an alarm spell
	- In the books, [[Runa]] finds information on ritual binding (e.g., binding an entity to a place, binding powers to people)
	- There is also a very old tome with familiar looking runes that seems to be a translation book but has ripped pages
	- Looking at the burned parchment [[Davelor]] found, [[Runa]] finds that some of them might be the ripped pages from the translation book, but some are also different
- Opening the trapdoor to investigate downstairs, we find a smaller room that seems to be a laboratory
	- On the shelves, [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] finds two more bottes of the [[Potion of Water Breathing|mystery potion]], and a [[|bag]] (rust colored, blue cords) that has three fuzzy balls (which emanate some magical aura)
	- In a cavity hidden in the floor below a rope, Ruby and Davelor find a small wooden box emanating an aura of illusion magic
- We all head out of the hut to carefully open the box via mage hands in the open, a [[Deck of Illusions|deck of cards]] is revealed that [[Runa]] after some hesitance picks up and investigates
	- It is a deck of cards with some cards missing
	- Attempting to do a magic trick with the cards, she accidentally drops on and a fire giant appears in front of her. She combines quickly that it must be an illusion and tries to touch the giant, who is indeed illusory and obeys to her command to dance
	- Picking up the card, both the card and the giant vanish
	- We now have a [[Deck of Illusions]] with 21 cards left

### Wanted, undead or alive
- As [[Asurak]] shows the handkerchief that he found to the rest of the group, they decide to try to follow the scent left on it
	- [[Avaaros Wolfwalker|Avaaros]] immediately recognizes the handkerchief as his mother [[Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]’s but doesn’t tell the group
- Turning into a wolf, Avaaros is able to confirm his mother’s smell but also a rotten smell on it and is able to follow the smell to a nearby area with weirdly assembled stones: a graveyard
- [[Davelor]] detects undead just as we are attacked by [[Zombies]] and [[Skeletons]] merging from the graves
- The zombies and skeletons are not too much of a challenge for the skilled frontline-fighters of the group, but soon two large plant-creatures join the fight and manage to swallow some of the compatriots 
- Unknown to the others, [[Runa]] - who had been contributing to the fight from further away as usual – is ambushed from behind during the fight and is held with a throat to her knife by the [[Gormon|elf]] they had been attempting to follow
- As the fight subdues, the others realize the hostage situation and try to talk to the [[Gormon|elf]]
	- He demands to know what we want and why we asked about the [[Herathis Mines]]
	- After some unsuccessful explanation and discussion attempts, the [[Gormon|elf]] summons a portal and takes [[Runa]] with him through it
	- As that is happening, the group hears a [[Syrja|female voice]] shouting something like “No, don’t”
