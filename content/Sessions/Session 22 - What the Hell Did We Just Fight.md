### Let's Make a Plan
- before heading down to face [[People & Groups/Gormon]], we try to talk about tactics
	- we want to first try to talk to them ([[People & Groups/Syrja]] to [[People & Groups/Gormon]] and [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] to [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]])
	- if that doesn't work, we'll try to overwhelm them without killing them
	- killing is the last option
- the spellcasters and the people who are supposed to talk each get a [[Items/Potion of Water Breathing]] to be used in case of a scenario similar to our dream (but [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] also has a waterbreathing spell)

### Dreams and Realities
- we walk downstairs and appear again in front of the river with the three arches
- we cross the river and head into the cave beyond
- [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] is sitting on a step in the stones but isn't reacting to us
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] tries to talk to her but also doesn't get a reaction
- Suddenly we all (except [[Asurak]] because of the [[Items/Ring of Mind Shielding]]) hear a dark, raspy voice in our heads
	- the voice tells us that it is very old and remembers a time when the Gods walked the earth (pre-calamity)
	- they say that they possessed [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] because they cannot leave but she can, so they need her
	- they showed her memories
- a figure with a fish-like body, tentacles, and three red eyes appears: an [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]]
- a fight ensues
	- water elementals are summoned out of two wells in the cavern
	- the [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]] can turn ethereal and drains [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] for his wn health
	- [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] also attacks us
	- at some point, the [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]] talks to [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] about some commonalities with the [[People & Groups/Raven Queen]] (which the rest didn't hear)
	- the [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]] calls [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] a traitor
	- [[People & Groups/Gormon]] appears
	- [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]]'s wall of water downs almost everyone except [[Asurak]] (and [[Runa]]'s attempt to counterspell it is counterspelled by [[People & Groups/Gormon]])
	- with his last bit of strength, [[Asurak]] kills the [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]]

### The Aftermath
- With the death of the [[Monsters & Foes/Aboleth]], [[People & Groups/Cecilia Wolfwalker|Cecilia]] and [[People & Groups/Gormon]] stop fighting us
- Everyone is healed but [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]], [[Runa]], and [[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]] are poisoned
	- their skin is translucent, air is caustic to them, thes need to be constantly moisturized
- But [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[People & Groups/Syrja]] are dead
	- [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] manages to revivify [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] but his attempt to also revive [[People & Groups/Syrja]] is unsuccessful (you can only revive creatures that still have souls)
