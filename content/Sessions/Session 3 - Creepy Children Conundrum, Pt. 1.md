### Ambush of the Scarecrows
- [[Runa]] and [[Reznak]] approach the farm of the Cordisons ([[People & Groups/Sammy Cordison|Sammy]]’s parents) to talk to [[People & Groups/Sammy Cordison|Sammy]]
- As the paths cross through some wheat fields, they hear rustling in the fields and are attacked by an animated [[Scarecrow]]
	- The [[Scarecrow]] is immune to the sleep spell (possibly undead?) but very vulnerable to fire
	- Seeing them being attacked, a stranger ([[Asurak]], the Half-Orc Babarian) comes to help
	- Together, they fight off the first [[Scarecrow]] (it crumbles down), however, a second one appears and attacks
	- As the second [[Scarecrow]] is also defeated and no others seem to appear, [[Runa]] and [[Reznak]] thank the stranger for his help and explain that they are there to talk to the **Cordisons** about the missing children
	- [[Asurak]] goes to knock on the **Cordisons**’ door

### Pub Brawl at the Silver Hatchet
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] meet up at the marketplace and share their gathered information
- They head to the [[Places/Silver Hatchet]] where everybody wanted to meet up (and where [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]] is known to be sometimes)
- The [[Places/Silver Hatchet]] is a small, two-story Tavern, not well-lit, filled with heavy oak tables
- Inside, there is only two guests and the barkeep (a strong-build, dark-haired, dar-eyed man, „burly fella“)
- Asked about the missing children (possibly in a somewhat clumsy way that implies he had something to do with it), the barkeep gets very grumpy
- [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] recognizes [[People & Groups/Trent]], a close associate (butler/assistant) of [[People & Groups/Lord Roseseeker|Roseseeker]]], in one of the guests
	- He is known to be very loyal and close to his master
- As [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] try to get [[People & Groups/Trent]] to talk to them outside of the tavern, thing turn a little hostile, they get into a fight with him
	- [[People & Groups/Trent]] wears platemail, uses a warhammer (that deals psychic damage)
	- A stranger ([[The Bean Bois/Tia|Tia]]) enters the bar and upon seeing the fight, tries to help [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] and [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]]
	- Avaaros turn into a Direwolf
	- Trent casts enlarge unto himself
	- In the end, all three of them are unconscious
- [[The Bean Bois/Davaelor]] almost died, he suffers a critical head wound
- Avaaros, Davelor, and the stranger are shortresting in the [[Places/Golden Comb Tavern & Inn|Golden Comb]]


### The Weird Kid and the Goo
- Meanwhile, [[Ruby]] and [[The Bean Bois/Heilar]] go see [[People & Groups/Thiobait Dup|Thiobait]], one of the disappeared-but-reappeared kids
- They find out he is acting creepy and weird since he came back talking to some goo that drips out of his walls.
- They talk to the kid, the [[Goo Monster]] attacks, they kill it and survive 
- As they leave, the traumatized weirdo of a kid tells them: „she lives in the woods“
