### We Shall Pass
- We arrive at the mine on a carved plateau under a stone overhang
- Over the gates there is a carved writing of “[[Herathis Mines]] under the xxx of King Bertrand Dwendal”
- We show our letter to the crownsguard at the entrance and are let in
- We follow voices to find the [[Eirrendell Kevandor|work manager]] arguing with an employee, a badass dwarven woman called [[Corinna Minatore]], about work safety
- We interrupt to offer our help and learn that they don’t have an [[Ankheg]] problem but that there are problems with some little critters and with bigger [[Phase Spiders|spiders]]
	- They usually don’t come up beyond the 2nd level (and they don’t go below that) but its getting more
	- They also heard noises of something much scarier (whimpering sound, like a wounded animal)
	- A worker named [[Jared]] (dwarf, no beard) has been missing, he is the engineer who could fix the broken elevators
	- There are few workers out there right now, but there are some outposts of equipment we could use 
	- The [[Phase Spiders|spiders]] make big nets and are drawn to flame
	- There is a spring below the mine
- Eventually, we are allowed to explore the mine and fight the spiders, but the work manager doesn’t promise us any additional payment

### Level 1: (Dis-)Appearing Spiders 
- We start exploring the first level of the [[Herathis Mines]] and spot a chest in a dimly-lit cavern
- Feeling the need to know what’s in the chest, we approach it and are attacked by [[Phase Spiders]] that can attack and then disappear. We kill 5 of these spiders and find [[Gauntlets of Ogre Power]] that [[Ruby]] is now wearing in the chest
- Exploring a little further, we are soon again attacked by [[Bulettes]], huge beasts with claws burrowing up from below
- After killing them, [[The Bean Bois/Avaaros|Avaaros]] finds an [[Immovable Rod]]
- We find the tunnel to the second level and descend
